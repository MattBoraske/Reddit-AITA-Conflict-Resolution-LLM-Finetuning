{"submission_texts": ["my brother 'fred' and his wife 'sarah', are not very financially stable, so it was a bit of a surprise for my sister, 'katie' and i when they announced that they were pregnant. however, we kept it to ourselves. a few months ago, katie planned a family trip. brother and sil decided to opt out as they were cutting costs for the baby. at this, mom and dad decided to cancel the trip altogether and have another one later, since mom's health wasn't too great either. this greatly irked katie as she was really looking forward to this trip and made some very unsubtle remarks that fred and sarah shouldn't be having children if they don't have money. this very clearly upset both of them.\n\nunfortunately, due to several complications, the baby was stillborn. it has been a month, and my brother and sil are understandably still devastated. especially my sil's mental health is not very well as of now.\n\nyesterday, i hosted a little family dinner at my home, with sister, brother, sil and our parents. some time before dinner, sil went to the bathroom, and meanwhile, my husband asked fred if she was doing well. before fred could reply, katie jumped in and said, \"well, though the loss is very sad, think of this as a good thing. at least you don't have to worry about money anymore. as i said, you shouldn't be bringing kids into this world unless you are sure you can provide for them.\"\n\nfred went red-faced and said that they would have been able to provide for their child. they may not have money for extra luxuries, but they would do everything for their child. he was almost crying and purple with anger, so i quickly dragged katie away to the kitchen and demanded what had possessed her to say something so insensitive.\n\nshe got incredibly defensive and said that she had made a very practical observation and she was 100% correct. it was better to see straight than be clouded by emotions. by that time, sarah had come out of the bathroom and was shocked to see fred in tears. she kept on getting hysterical and asking what was wrong. i knew that katie's presence would ruin things further, and i asked her to get out. she looked incredibly hurt and angry, but went out anyway.\n\nfortunately, our parents were late and didn't have to see the whole spectacle. when they came home and found out what had happened, they were shocked and upset at katie too, but mom thinks that perhaps i shouldn't have kicked katie out like this. aita?\n\n&amp;#x200b;", "i had a very short relationship with a woman. we weren't really together because i don't well, have relationships with people very often because it disgusts me. i have diagnosed ocd but would be a germaphobe even without that. i've been in therapy but some things don't go away. i don't have as many of the rituals, but i can't just ignore how disgusting people are. i can't deal with bodily fluids at all. i know immediately when something (ex. a baby needing a diaper change while i'm holding them) happens and i just need them away from me so i can try to not need to leave immediately to go puke and/or take a shower.\n\ni also have epilepsy, and with my meds and condition, i have to have a solid 8 hours of sleep every night. there are no exceptions to this unless i want to be of even less help and end up in the hospital with potentially now ineffective meds. because of these two things, i never wanted to have children or thought that it would happen. i've always used condoms on the rare occasions that it came up, but one condom breaks and here we are.\n\nwhen my child's mother got pregnant, i made sure she was aware of these things, but she chose to keep the baby anyway. we broke up, and while there is no formal child support, i try to help. i visit her and the baby multiple times a week and can hold the baby so she can go do something else, it just can't last that long before she has to come deal with it. i cannot change diapers or do feeds or anything like that. \n\nshe is now complaining that she has to do everything by herself, is overwhelmed, and has no help because she can't just have constant visitors like in normal times and i \"don't do anything\" (because i literally can't). i reminded her that she knew what she signed up for when she insisted on keeping the baby and now she's mad at me and is enlisting whoever she can. am i in the wrong here? she chose this knowing that i wouldn't be able to help her beyond money.", "i have been in this choir for 20+ years. the church is my home parish and the pastor is a sweet man. they alternate between english and spanish choirs every other week. i am a core member of the spanish choir; i have participated in some of the english choirs off and on, more off than on.  (i can\u2019t stand their singing style or choice of hymns.)\n\naround 2017 i joined the (english) choir at a nearby church which has a better overall music program. i enjoy singing there and have gradually taken on more responsibilities. however, it is not a parish community that i would be comfortable joining officially.\n\nthe schedule at the new church still allows me to participate in the spanish choir at my home church, it\u2019s just that every other week i sing two masses, one at each. it does mean i have to cut out quick after the 10:30 mass to make it to noon mass at the other church.\n\ni also travel a lot, so i miss mass at both parishes when i\u2019m out of town. the leader of the spanish choir has also been gone a lot lately. i\u2019ve mentioned to her that i have problem with the new guy\u2019s singing style and attitude.\n\na few weeks before christmas, w were going over the spanish music before mass and the new guy (he\u2019s not in any leadership role by the way) advocated for singing more verses of the closing hymn than we usually do. it\u2019s a song we all like and sing well, but this congregation will leave after the priest recesses out no matter what we do.\n\nso i said (half kidding) \u201cokay you guys sing as much as you want, but i have to leave for another mass so i\u2019m only good for two verses.\u201d\n\nthe self-important jerk immediately started going off on me, how i don\u2019t belong in this group if i can\u2019t stay after and move chairs etc. me: \u201cso you want me out of this choir?\u201d he said yes. (mind you, this individual is never less than 20 minutes late to practice before mass.)\n\nactually the first thing i said was \u201cfuck you\u201d but he was talking so loud that no one heard me. i\u2019m kinda glad about that.\n\nthe choir leader was not present and none of them said a word. i picked up my music books and left. i was supposed to sing the psalm and gospel acclamation so someone called out \u201cwhat about the psalm?\u201d and i replied over my shoulder \u201cone of you will have to learn it.\u201d\n\nalthough i feel pretty relieved to be out of that mess, i acted pretty immature for a 62-year-old. this also severs my last bond to that parish so i am homeless as far as churches go. i realize that none of those people (except maybe the choir leader) were ever my friends.", "my kids attend a year round school and started back up for the new term 2 weeks ago. my eldest (16f) ended up getting her phone confiscated for using it during class to watch tiktok. we had discussed this before she even got the phone, then had some issues last year. as a last resort, i told her if that happened again, the phone would become mine and she\u2019d get an old flip phone that was my husband\u2019s  with no internet until she could prove trust. \n\nthe school policies had changed this term from a phone would be confiscated until a parent could come get it to a phone would be kept for 2 weeks as a first offense, 3 for second, so on and so forth. i wasn\u2019t okay with this as i don\u2019t trust the school to not lose it (i know they\u2019ve lost/broken other students\u2019 phones) plus i don\u2019t want them having access to my daughter\u2019s private info. i went to the school and requested it back, saying i wouldn\u2019t give it to my daughter but i paid for it. secretary gave me the spiel and i didn\u2019t blame her but asked to speak with the vice principal. he comes out and repeats them. i said okay but i\u2019m the parent, i paid for it and i never signed anything giving you permission to hold it. they were refusing so i said i\u2019d sit in the office until it was given back. i did so and waited for close to 2 hours. finally the principal came out and said i needed to leave. i said if i left, i\u2019d be back with a police escort. at that point, the phone was returned to me.\n\n\nmy husband says i \u201ckaren\u2019d\u201d my way out of

this point. i have tried my best to be supportive of her in any way i can , for eg i call her by her new name and i have introduced her to some of my female friends cause i guess she'll need their support.\n\nhowever , my sister has recently been very upset with me because i no longer share my private info with her. so for example, i don't tell her my crushes . i also refuse to roughhouse with her. this is something my parents support( when i was younger , my dad used to get upset if i roughhoused with my girl cousins). this has also extended to my friends. now that she is a girl , we no longer feel comfortable telling her about how hot a friend looks.etc. what i don't understand about her being upset is that when she was a boy , she would not have said those things to a girl either! i do think she is being hypocritical.\nmy closest female friend (who is now close to my sis ) has told me that she thinks i am punishing my sis . i think that is bs , cause it is not as if i tell those things to any other girl.\n\nso aita for no longer being comfortable with telling my sis somethings?", "yesterday, my (32m) wife (31f), our two kids (4f) and (2m), and some extended family went for a walk in the mountains. i say 'walk' instead of 'hike' because there were several trails that didn't involve actually having to hike. \n\nall went well until we stopped at a rest spot. my wife is five months pregnant, and is damn well determined to keep active before she gets too exhausted to do so. the rest spot only had once small bench to sit at to stop and rest for a minute, and the family (except myself, my wife, and my father) all took turns sitting. my sister (20f) sat down for a few minutes with our daughter while everybody got pictures, and i asked her if she could stand up because my wife's back was bothering her. \n\nmy sister refused. just to make it clear, she has no back issues, leg injuries, chronic pain, etc. she told me that, if my wife's back hurt so bad, then she should've sat down first. my wife told her that she wanted to be polite and let everyone else go first. my sister said that 'your pregnancy isn't my problem' and our mom got the 'mom' look on her face and told her to stand up, so she did. \n\nwhile my wife was sitting down, my sister came up to me and said that being an 'entitled victim' wasn't a good look for my wife and i, and i told her that she'd already had a few minutes, and it was my wife's turn. she replied that it was unfair and that she really felt sorry for my kids, and i snapped at her and told her that it was her future kids that should be pitied. the group started moving on so our argument was cut short but now i can't stop thinking about it. \n\ni'm not going to bring it up with my wife, because i don't want to upset her, but i can't stop wondering if we did act entitled.", "\n\n\nmy late wife and i invested in a small winter cabin years ago. i'm the owner now after her passing. my son (22) is getting married to his stbw in a month. they have no money for a destination honeymoon, they were barely able to plan the wedding. he asked if they could spend their honeymoon in my winter cabin and i agreed but under the condition that they pay me. he acted all shocked and tried to argue that it's his mom's cabin too but i pointed out how i'm the owner now and that i pay to keep it maintained. he got upset and accused me of being materialistic and selfish after i'd already been unhelpful with the wedding. i told him i did the same thing with his aunt and it wasn't personal. he left with his fiancee and told the family about it.\n\n\nnow i'm being berating left and right and am being told to let him use the cabin and shamed me for asking for money.\n\n\ninfo: i already told him a millionth times that

terrible experiences from time-to-time where the delivery driver sat the food on my porch &amp; didn\u2019t bother to knock or it was the wrong order or the food was partially eaten (this really happened! i saw the driver take a drink out of a mango curry container we had ordered as i was outside already when she arrived.).    \n\nshit happens, life moves on, &amp; though irritating the good delivery experiences far outweigh the bad. and because the app forces me to tip ahead of time i always tip at least 20%, even if it means modifying the tip amount to make sure it is at least 20%. because most delivery drivers deserve that or more.    \n\nhere\u2019s the problem, and this all takes place over the course of months. there is a particular delivery driver in my area that we\u2019ll call mk (mk has a very unique name.) mk delivers for both grubhub &amp; doordash. the first time he delivered to us he got lost &amp; i talked him through finding our house (we\u2019re not hard to find, i don\u2019t know why he was so confused.) mk was pleasant &amp; apologized for the delay in delivery. no problem. second time mk delivered to us he picked up the food &amp; then sat at one location for over an hour. i texted him to ask if he had an eta because i thought maybe my app had frozen &amp; he called back to say he was at my apartment complex &amp; couldn\u2019t find the right unit. i gave him our address (a house, not apartment) &amp; what our order was &amp; he hung up on me. and then the app said our order had been cancelled. on another order mk was assigned again, and he did deliver the food successfully, but he texted me before he had even picked up the food &amp; gave an eta. i thought it was pretty nice of him to do that. but, come 30 min later, the app says he\u2019s on his way but i see him sitting at a completely different restaurant on the map. for over 10 min. then 20 min. then 30 min. i text him to see what\u2019s up &amp; he replies that i need to be patient. so i mentioned i would cancel the order. he texted afterwards &amp; was all kinds of apologetic. \n\none of the last times mk was assigned as the delivery driver i cancelled the order as soon as i saw his name pop-up. and i\u2019ve done it twice more, once when he was almost at the restaurant before the app updated with his name.\n\nmy husband says i\u2019m a unsympathetic asshole. he pointed out that i have no idea how cancelling like that affects mk\u2019s income or job. and he\u2019s right, i don\u2019t know. i don\u2019t know if i care.      \n\naita for cancelling orders when i see that the delivery driver assigned is mk?", "throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. \n\nto preface this, i (24f) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. i have not eaten meat since i was roughly 3-4 years old when i found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). this is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so i thought. \n\n\nfour nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down \"are these vegan?\" to which my friends replied \"yeah, they're sunfed\" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong. \n\ni found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends snapchat story. the story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where i asked if it was vegan). the and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when i found out i ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling \"the chickens!!!\"). i took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. \n\nthey all think that i'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so reddit, aita? in my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. in their view, it was just a prank.", "throwaway account\n\nsome background info: i (50 f) have 2 adult kids mike (30) and marie (29) and both are married. the last 5 or so years we have had to have a split christmas where one kid and spouse will come over one day and the other another day. this is just how its worked out between their work schedules and their spouse family christmas gatherings. now onto the issue\n\ni texted them both yesterday asking if they can still come over christmas eve. mike said yes but marie wasn't aware that i was planning a gathering then and said she couldn't come due to work and her husband's family gathering. we can't all do christmas day either because mike and his wife are having her family over for a gathering. so i asked if sunday would work and marie said yes but mike said no unless it was later in the evening since he has to work. i was over trying to beg for a bit of family time so i just texted both of them and said i'd leave their presents on their porches since there's no time for our family anyway and it seems to them that our family doesn't matter, only their spouses families. they both tried calling and texting me but i ignored them.\n\nlater on my husband convinced me to do sunday after 3. i told the kids this but said that since they don't care about our family anymore this will be the last family christmas for good. i'm not dealing with my family being forgotten by my kids. marie then told me stop being such an asshole and to stop acting like a martyr. i really don't think i'm in the wrong though. my kids are the ones not making time for the family. so, aita?", "i (26f) live with my husband (27m) and a roommate (32m). he has lived at my house for the past year and a half, but for awhile didn\u2019t pay any rent at all. we fed him and got him a phone because he\u2019s had a tough life and we wanted to help. the deal was supposed to be that he would keep the common areas as well as his areas clean. he never really did this, and if i asked him to do something, he would always completely half ass it (if i asked him to clean the kitchen, all he would do is sweep and he\u2019d leave obvious areas that had not been swept or dirt). when i ask him to clean, because i feel we\u2019ve done so much for him and he has never kept up his end of the deal, he gets mad and says that i always make him do the chores i don\u2019t want to do, and he is tired and should just get to relax. he accuses me of making him do the \u201ccharlie work\u201d and taking advantage of him.\n\nhe has always eaten my food, which i have been trying to stop him from doing for months. he started paying rent (he pays 1/3 of the mortgage and bills now). when i ask him to buy his own food, he says he hardly eats at home, etc.\ni have offered to grocery shop for him if he made a list and reimbursed me. he also declined this. he has his kids every other weekend, and never buys any food for them. they always eat all of my stuff including special things i save for myself. the last example was an entire family size bag of beef jerky (i barely got any). they always eat all of the cereal and pretty much everything i have. when i asked him to buy his kids food, he said \u201cyou\u2019re the one who wants me to pay so much in rent, so..\u201d it is $600 with all utilities included. he buys weed all of the time and vapes all of the time. if he did not do this, he would be able to buy his kids food. on top of this, he does not have a car and will always expect my husband to take him to and from work. he also sometimes expects my husband to take him to get his kids. my husband has covid and he wanted him to take him to get his kids. they are an hour and a half away. \n\ni\u2019ve finally had it. i took all of my food besides canned foods/raw ingredients out of the kitchen and hid it in my room (save for salads, eggs, and milk) and hid the frozen things really well below the dog food in the freezer. we\u2019ve decided we are done helping him. so, am i the asshole for hiding all of my food and choosing not to help him anymore?", "i (21f) have a brother (28) who came out as gay last month. he has been married to my best friend's big sister (24) for four years, they have 2yo twin daughters together. i'm really close with her, so i've been trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. \n\nmy brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. he said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from grindr for over a year behind her back. she obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. he said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. she asked him what about the effect on her life? she is now a single mother to two toddlers. he was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. after she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. \n\nsince then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. he has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted she was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.\n\ni told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and i don't want to be involved with him anymore because i think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. i told him i get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). he said i'm being a homophobic asshole, and that i don't know how hard it is to come out. he said that if i don't accept him, i'm a bigot. he made mistakes and what not. i said maybe i will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. i gave up at this point. my sisters (17&amp;24) both think i'm being homophobic, my mom agrees with me. aita?", "my

to hell\u201d sermon, shouting a lot of the time. i felt this was entirely inappropriate, it was my grandmother\u2019s memorial service, and this man, who didn\u2019t even know her well, used her death as a way to preach his opinion to her grieving family. a lot of my family isn\u2019t even christian, they\u2019re jehovah\u2019s witnesses, so he told them repeatedly they\u2019re going to burn in hell with satan while they cried over their dead relative. \n\nthe whole thing made me sick, and i really want to message him and tell him i didn\u2019t appreciate that message at the service. i wanted to say something directly after the service, but my family was around and i didn\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers. the church is tiny and doesn\u2019t even have a website, so this is the only way i\u2019m aware of to reach the pastor. should i just let it go? would it be a major dick move to message him since i didn\u2019t say anything directly after? a few relatives also didn\u2019t enjoy

away about a month ago. \n\ncut to about two weeks ago, and my partner decides to get a new puppy without letting me know. apparently it's a german shepard pug mix that they found on craigslist. i was furious, and told them that i didn't want another dog in our house. they told me it was unfair that i still had my cat, and that they were only. they then told me that they couldn't return it, so it would just have to say. after contacting the seller myself and being told the same thing, i finally relented.\n\ni hated this dog. it was loud, untrained, and constantly made messes. my partner did try their best to train it, but i didn't see much progress. i finally had enough after coming home only to see that dog ripping my stuffed care bear to shreds. i've had it ever since i was little, and despite how immature it sounds, have trouble sleeping without it close by. i was furious. \n\nhere's where i think i may be the asshole. i contacted a few friends and coworkers, and eventually found

father.\n\njohn was understandably humiliated and angry. i was fully on his side.  i was disgusted with matt and the fiance.\n\nhere's my issue though. at john's insistence, matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. he isn't allowed at any gatherings where john is. and john purposely makes sure he is at every one. \n\nmatt married john's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.\n\nto this day, matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. only by john but in our family's presence. he hates them with a passion even today.\n\nmy parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow john's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. even contact with matt is done in secret.\n\nmatt has been kicked out of our family business because john can't be in the same room as him. all photos of matt have been hidden in the family home. no gifts have been given to matt's child at all.\n\nam i absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? \n\nmatt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. he clearly regrets hurting our brother.\n\ni can understand that john is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.\n\nbut i still love both my brothers. matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?\n\nmy poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. they have confided in me that they are willing to forgive matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. we were such a tight knit family before.\n\nbut i'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with john will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them. i also worry about his mental health.\n\nthere also the innocent child in this. he deserves a relationship with his grandparents and his aunt.\n\ni have recently been visiting matt and his family. they are clearly struggling with the isolation. his wife broke down and apologized as i held my nephew for the first time. my heart tore in two.\n\naita for wanting to bring them into our family again and forgiving them? there is family reunion coming up in a week and i want them to

old apartment and walked in on us being intimate twice (but my husband didn't think it was big deal) i just couldn't trust her so i just sent her a fake key (after she kept pushing) and she had a smug on her face after i hand delivered it to her.\n\n\ndays gone by and on christmas dinner mil angerily \"called me out\" on the fact i gave her a fake copy of the house key. she shamed me for doing this in front of everyone but in my defensive i asked her how she found out and she said days ago when she came over at 4 while my husband and were out. i reminded her \"didn't you promise you wouldn't use it unless there's an emergency? so you tried to get in when there was no emergency and you broke the promise you made to us!\" she looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. she suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally i've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. my husband went off on me in the car and said i lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. we had an argument and he is demanding i apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining christmas dinner for the whole family.\n\naita?\n\neta so this went off unexpectedly and i thought i'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments i found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said i was nuts to talk about his family online. he demanded my phone so he could delete it but i refused and i went upstairs and into the bedroom. i never seen him so agitated and i didn't think he'd react like that honestly. but thank you guys for your support. it really means so much. i'll update if i can. thanks again :)", "hey y'all. read carefully before giving judgement!.\n\nso my wife (f24) and i (m27) had our son 3 months ago. luckily as new parents we've had less issues compared to others in our family but what really created an issue was the fact that my wife gets wayyyy more bonding time with my son than i do. she breastfeeds and doesn't let me come anywhere near her while she's doing it claiming she was already in pain and i was making her stressed out with my behavior. she'd promise to let me have my bonding time once she's done but she takes a long time feeding and then the baby goes to sleep so i get pretty much,...almost, no time to bond with him.\n\n\nit all came to head for me last night after my wife told me to leave the room while she was feeding our son cause i was '''bothering,,, her and making her feel '''stressed out,,, with my ''\"judgemental,,, comments but i was just making sure she was feeding our son properly since she's dealing with stress and possible ppd and so i had to **(not under doctor's recommendation though but following my mom's advice)** be present in every feeding session to make sure nothing goes wrong and...like i said before maybe get a chance to bond with my son but it didn't end well and i refused to leave the room. she tried to unload on me about how unsupportive and difficult i was being but i told her she was wrong to exclude me and take away my attempt at bonding with my son and that it's only fair that i get to have equal time she has with him and suggested that she switch to formula so she has no way of keeping me excluded and again so i could get 50% of the time she has with him. she called me unreasonable and explained that even though i'm the parent too she as a mother is essentially what our son needs and relies on so her role is more important and she gets more time than i do simply because she's the mother. .....then she explained that my request was ridiculous because she is blessed to have almost no issues with bf and switching to formula was absolutely uncalled for and can not be afforded right now but i disagreed and argued that she left me no choice and that she needs to respect whatever decision i make regarding our son even if she doesn't like it and doesn't necessary agree with it but she argued back saying i'm delusional to think she'll just switch to formula to fix my hurt '''feefees,,, and even accused me of making this request so mom could meddle in and start feeding our son formula and have sleepovers since she was against her breastfeeding from the start due to how weak she was before. this really had me...kind of...lose my cool ngl. i told her that couldn't be further from the truth. matter fact, i strongly believe her refusal to consider switching to formula is mainly to spite mom not because she thinks my request was '''unreasonable,,,\n\nlong story short, we kept going back and forth on this argument and she told me to drop it but i refused because in my opinion she's being selfish by how she's treating me as the other parent.", "i (22f) and my brother (20m) are attending different colleges, but they're both in the same city. i'm classmates with this guy (22m), let's call him \"david\". he's really handsome, fit and smart, but also quiet the player. most of my female friends have had one night stands with him and there are rumors going around about him sleeping with half the college, including some of the teachers. so imagine my surprise when i found out that my brother started dating him. yeah, he hasn't kept it a secret that he's bi and that he experimented with guys before, but i seriously didn't expect that my brother of all people to be his type. i seriously thought they were gonna break up pretty fast, as david doesn't seem like the type to settle down easily, but surprisingly, him and my brother are still together after over half an year. and my brother has become really annoying during this period, pretty much all he's doing now is gush about david and act like he's the best thing since sliced bread, not to mention how he's following him like a puppy whenever they go together to an event. \n\nyesterday was my brother's birthday and he once again kept praising david, this time about his cooking skills. apparently he made him a special dinner and birthday cake, which i said that seemed cheap and it's kinda worrying that his own boyfriend doesn't want to spend money on him. my brother intervened and said that he never really liked the material gifts for his birthday and he's so glad that david picked up on that and was willing to put so much effort to make his birthday truly special, which really made him hopeful about their future together. i, however, wasn't impressed and told my brother that he should hold his horses and that david isn't the type to settle down and he's probably just an \"experiment\" to him. my brother asked me what the hell i was talking about and i told him about how he used to sleep with pretty much everyone in college before they started dating and that there are even rumors about him sleeping with teachers just to keep his grades high. and considering that his grades haven't lowered since they started dating, i would be on guard around him if i was in his place. my brother went silent and pretty much stopped talking with me for the rest of the day, but at night i got a message from david telling me to stop spreading \"fake\" rumors about him and to stop trying to sabotage his relationship with my brother. however, i don't really think i was doing any of that, all i did was just warn my brother about the possibility of getting misled by david down the line, but david doesn't see things that way and thinks i'm actively trying to sabotage them.\n\nso aita for expressing my concerns to my brother ?", "my brother is getting married soon. he gave his fianc\u00e9e unlimited control over the wedding planning, and she asked me to help her because she had never planned a big event before and my family are known for throwing extravagant parties, so she feels a lot of pressure to get this right. \n\nyesterday i met up with her and her best friend \u201cjade\u201d to brainstorm ideas before she meets her wedding planner. things were going fine but i noticed that whenever my sil would suggest something or seem really excited by an idea, jade would always criticise it and put her off. she also kept comparing things to her wedding and was acting like her wedding, which was nice but not something to be jealous over based on the pictures she kept showing me, was the gold standard. after about 3 hours of looking through things, my sil looked like she was giving up because jade kept criticising everything and to me it seemed like she was trying to make sure my sil\u2019s wedding was worse than hers. jade also kept picking the cheapest (and usually ugliest) options and i got the impression that she didn\u2019t want my sil to spend more than she did because she kept bringing up money, even though my brother was clear that there was no budget for the wedding and this was just supposed to be a brainstorming day, so it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nwe started looking at potential venues and my sil really liked one, but the estimate prices were high. based on the pictures, the venue was beautiful. jade immediately started criticising it and was trying to convince my sil to pick the cheaper, less nice venue we had seen before. honestly, i was fed up of her putting all of her ideas down so i jokingly said she had cheap taste and the guests will expect better. jade got so defensive and angry. she kept going on about how something being more expensive doesn\u2019t make it better and how she liked the other venue because it had more character. things quickly wrapped up after that and today my sil text me to say jade was very upset with me over what i said and that she didn\u2019t think she could come to anymore wedding planning sessions if i would be there, unless i apologise. \n\nbefore i decide if i will apologise or not, i was wondering aita?", "my brother lost his job along with all his savings several months ago, and soon after he asked me if it would be okay if he (28m) and his wife (30f) stayed with me until they could afford their own place again. i hesitated at first, considering i only have a 1 bedroom apartment, but according to them they had 'no other options' so of course i invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.\n\nfor the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. the living room is by far the biggest room i have, so i told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/tv/bookshelves.  the living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so i reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.\n\nit's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. when they first moved in, i would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. now whenever i go in, there's a strange vibe like i'm intruding. my brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when i go in (i always knock) and stare at me pointedly until i leave. sometimes when i sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.\n\nthis came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. the timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.\n\ni basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no way i'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. she sent me back a huge message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. \n\ni tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when i got home neither my brother/sil were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. today an amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which i told him there's 'absolutely no way' i will allow him to install. my brother says i'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.\n\naita for not giving my brother and his wife their privacy?", "hey all. kind of hard to find unbiased opinions irl so i figured i\u2019d turn here. \n\ni (29m) had a kid with my ex-wife (32f) 10 years ago, my daughter. and there\u2019s no real way to sugarcoat this but as soon as she was born, i left and i never ended up seeing her in the hospital as a baby. was never really present in her life at any point but ended up getting a divorce 11 months later with her getting full custody of course. i married young, was really stupid and thought i\u2019d end up being a good dad despite no skills but got scared that i\u2019d turn out like my dad and chickened out. not really an excuse but an explanation i guess. i paid child support for the first 3 years but stopped afterwards.\n\ni\u2019ve been speaking with the girl\u2019s mother about reconnecting with her, but she thinks it\u2019s best that i stay out of their lives majorly. but i think making amends is always possible so i\u2019m not sure, i just really want to make things right but i will respect their decision. i\u2019ve seen her a few times but her mother has always introduced me as a friend. she says she will tell her when she is ready. \n\ni\u2019ve been dating a girl (28f) for about 10 months, and i really like her. i think i could definitely see a life for us and i know that sounds weird but she\u2019s also said the same. i was also speaking to my daughter\u2019s mother about meeting this girl, but she says absolutely not and that\u2019s a bad idea. but if i want to reintroduce her into my life isn\u2019t it fair that she gets to see my life too?\n\naita for this? her mother says it\u2019s a very bad idea, so it\u2019s making me think i am but i just genuinely cannot see why. obviously i care for this girl and i will care for her life too, but a relationship has to be two-sided i don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to show her my life too.", "final", "hi everybody. i was hoping for some input from this community that i've seen on all a few times.\n\ni'm a 39 year old man and my wife is a 33 year old woman. she stays at home and takes care of the house (no children yet) while i work. we're going on seven years of marriage. \n\nlast week, i received a large performance bonus, and i decided i would like to buy myself a nice blender with a small portion of the money. i know it's not the most exciting present to buy yourself, but i cook with a lot of purees and have a shake every morning. i've had two blenders die on me in the past three years and was determined to make my life easier. seeing as it was a financial decision, i told my wife as much, and she told me to show her before i ordered it.\n\ni researched a bunch of different models, shopped around, checked out safety ratings, and found one i wanted for just under $600. i called my wife to my computer, where i showed her the model that i wanted, and was mainly just confirming that she was fine with it too. she immediately responded by pointing at the suggested items list on the website, which showed a significantly cheaper model. she asked what i thought of that one, and i said it wasn't what i was looking for.\n\nthen she said i should get a nice hand mixer to save some money. i kind of chuckled and said that i didn't really want one of those. she responded with \"well, then how about this blender? it's $500 cheaper than the one you chose.\"\n\ni reiterated that i was really looking for a good one that i could use for over a decade, but she was completely undeterred. she essentially took over my computer, and then began the race to the bottom of finding the cheapest possible blender, as i stood by repeating the same point about being in the market for a quality product. at one point she was on alibaba showing me an $11 product that would probably take a month to ship.\n\ni was at my limit at this point, so i finally just said i'd think about it. she left the room to start making dinner, and i ordered the $600 one that i wanted. i figured when the blender got to our house i'd explain.\n\ntwo days later, it arrived. she asked me how much it had cost (she didn't even recognize it), and i said it was the one i had shown her. she immediately began sulking and said that i didn't care about her opinion, to which i responded i told her i'd think about it. then she asked when i had ordered it, and i responded about three minutes after she left the room. i thought about it in those minutes and made the decision i had put half a dozen hours of research into. \n\nshe's furious with me now and keeps repeating that i has no financial power in the house. i think she's being completely dramatic but she thinks i was way out of line. any input on who's right on this would be great!", "\ni m33 lost my 27 year old brother to cancer a couple of months ago. we were so close and had a lot in common. he was a gamer and had all types of gaming gear including a gaming chair that he wanted me to have before he died. it's devastating because we were really hoping and had plans to spend christmas 2021 together. this chair i consider special because it was my brother's favorite of all gear and it remindes me of him whenever i sit in it (i don't play anymore) it just brings me closer to him to a degree i can not explain and it brings me so much comfort.\n\n\ni keep the chair in my office and days ago i found out that my fiancee who has been out of job and complaining about no longer being able to attend the gym took the chair and sold it online to be able to pay for her next month's gym membership. when i found out i flipped out hugely and had a very negative reaction. she told me that she was desperate for money and after selling all she had she had no choice but to sell the chair. i reminded her of who this chair belongs to but she said i already have tons of keepsakes from my brother and so i shouldn't act like it was the end of the world. she also vented about her past eating disorders and her anxiety when it comes to keeping fit and claimed i was dismissing that she is struggling. i yelled at her and called her inconsiderate and selfish and told her she should have never ever took and sold any of my stuff for a gym membership when she literally could-ve kept working out from home. she started crying as we argued then she went to stay with her mom who tried to give me a stern talk about my attitude and but i didn't answer that and haven't been talking to my fiancee since then. things haven't got better and i got called overdramatic for reacting and treating my fiancee like that over a gaming chair. i feel guilty because i've never yelled at her in my life before.\n\naita? was i too hard on her?\n\nsome said i went overboard because this is a gaming chair and it was bit childish of me to make a fuss over it but i already explained why i had this reaction aside from the fact that money is an issue we already have.\n\nedit because i feel like i should add more of her side to the conflict: she told me if say i was struggling and needed money and sold some item she had then she wouldn't be mad at me but i'm not sure since i'd never do such thing but still she insisted that nomatter what i do she'll always be supportive and understanding just like i should be supportive and understanding of her struggle right now. that made me feel horrible

from her).\n\ni didn't know how much it was (i knew it was expensive, but i thought maybe $3k at most). i was visiting my sister last january when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. i won't lie, i didn't wear it after that because i was afraid of ruining it.\n\nlast week, i wore it while visiting my sister. while i was putting it back on to leave, i felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. i was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning.\n\nwhile i was in my car, still in shock btw, i got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said \"i'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts\". i saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. she did not reply, but i saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then).\n\nthe next day i found out my coat can not be saved, so i called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if i wanted a new one, i should get my husband to buy it for me. i think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, imo they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money). \n\nwe did not reach an agreement, so i told her that i will be suing, and reminded her that i have video evidence that her daughter a) did it on purpose for online clout and b) knew exactly how expensive it was.\n\npeople in my life are not objective at all, i have some calling me an ah, some saying they are the ahs for

host parties since aunt rona came to town but we both continued to smoke cigarettes and weed in the house. neither of us had a problem smoking anything indoors and neither did our landlord (it's a crazy college town. he wouldn't have gotten any tenants if he said they can't smoke inside the house). \n\nproblem came in the form of his pregnant friend about a month ago. he said that she got evicted and that she was jobless and needs a place to stay for a few days urgently. i agreed. obviously, we both stopped smoking inside the house. it was just for a few days, so i did my best to make her feel comfortable. but the more accomodations we made for her, the more she asked for. she didn't like when we played music or tv as she was a light sleeper and gets headache easily. the smell of meat makes her nauseous, so we can't cook or eat meat inside the house. \n\nme and my friend just went to the roof when we felt like having a smoke. days became weeks and i asked him when she was leaving. at this point, i am getting annoyed at not being able to do what i want in my own place. he told me how he is telling her nicely to leave without saying \"get out\", but she keeps either begging for some more time or starts crying and he backs out. \n\nweeks became a month and i have had enough. since yesterday, i have started smoking inside the house. i mean, it's not like i deliberately light up when she is in the room. ashtray is by the window, so i sit there and smoke when i want. if she is in the room, i just give her a heads up and then start smoking. i have also started watching netflix on the tv when we don't have classes and started cooking meat in the house again. \n\nyesterday night, she yelled at me about how an inconsiderate bitch i was and i reminded

nailed almost every single southern hillbilly stereotype on the head. we both did decently, but neither of us had ever considered college.\u00a0\n\n\ncaitlin graduated high school first and got a full time job immediately. she began to help with bills, but at some point began thinking about maybe going to school. i was having the same thoughts a year later when i graduated. well, what we hadn't known was that when our great-grandma died, she left my dad all that she had which came up to a sum of a couple thousand dollars that they decided to save for us. and because cait began talking about maybe going to school, mom began to save her bill money to add to the sum of the money. unfortunately, it still wasn't a lot, so our parents sat us down and explained that they had money for only one of us to go to school and that they would have to think about who to give it to.\u00a0\n\n\ni was prepared to fight for this chance, because i realized this was my chance to better myself. i was ready to do whatever it took, but i didn't end up needing to because cait gave up.\u00a0\n\n\ni guess caitlin realized she wouldn't be picked because i had better grades and was more well-liked because mom told me later that day that she had backed down and said to give it to me.\n\n\nso fast forward, i got my bsn and work as a travel nurse. i do very well for myself and live an 2hrs away from my hometown. i went to visit my sister because she's pregnant with my nephew and i missed her and brought some gifts. we had lunch and were just chatting about what we were up to when she began to complain and whine that she was tired and asked if i didn't mind if she vented. before i could answer, she started talking about how she was tired all of the time from her shifts at work and then having to come home to her kids and her husband. it sounded a lot like she was regretting her life and after about twenty minutes, it was starting to get on my nerves.\u00a0she would not stop or change topic. \n\n\nfinally, i lost it and told her that i wasn't here to listen to her complain and that she really shouldn't complain about the life she chose. i told caitlin that if she didn't have to get married or have a low paying job, and if she had wanted to better herself, she should've fought harder to go to college instead of giving up before she even tried. it ended in her crying, which i felt horrible about, and then she went home without saying anything else. i tried apologizing for how i phrased it, but not for anything i actually said because it was true, but she won't accept it. our parents have been giving me the cold shoulder and i feel lost because they won't listen to my side of why i said what i said. aita here??", "so i own a bulldog who\u2019s is great at alerting me

them. when i open the door there is blood all over my porch. and while the police are walking her across the gravel parking lot i notice she\u2019s not wearing shoes and over hear she is 16 years old.

think that this is some of the sketchiest shit i have ever heard. she asked her mom and she her mom said yes to letting her meet him but i have some issues with it. her mother won\u2019t even be there to go with her, she\u2019s in guatemala visiting family for the month.\n\ni offered to let her meet him for lunch as long as i come with her and he can prove that he\u2019s her real dad and not just some guy messaging her on social media claiming to be her dad. she got upset and said i was being overprotective and that i should just chill out and that it\u2019s her decision. if she wants to meet him that\u2019s her choice, she\u2019s right about that but i have every right to be overprotective. this is my baby girl we\u2019re talking about and is it wrong to not want her going to meet a

last year which broke my heart. nevertheless, me and will are trying to come to terms with everything and continue with our lives, but it's difficult. we thankfully have a lot of support from family which helps.\n\nsome background on my sister jane (29f). jane is nice and kind, but she does tend to pick arguments and gets emotional pretty easily, and doesn't really interact with our family a whole lot. she's the type of person that has everything but acts like she has nothing - like she has a successful career, good friends, she's beautiful etc., but she said that she feels meaningless and \"unsupported\" sometimes. again jane is wonderful, but she tries to act like the \"not like other girls\" sometimes. also another thing about her, she has said multiple times before she doesn't care about having kids. like she would play with our little cousins and likes kids in general, but doesn't want any of her own, which is fine because that's her choice.\n\na few days ago i met up with jane for lunch (i haven't physically seen her in a few months but we texted), she looked like she'd gained a bit of weight but i assumed it was from work stress or something. she then dropped the tidbit that she was 5 months along. i was shocked, mainly because i didn't know she was in a serious relationship and she never mentioned pregnancy when we talked.  she said that she slept with a guy she met at a club a couple times. again this was pretty shocking news to me (and jane was never the type for one night stands and stuff), i asked her if our parents knew and she said no. i asked what her plan was now, she said that she's looking forward to becoming a mom. this sort of felt like a punch in the gut, that me and my husband have been trying for so long to have a baby and my sister, who never wanted kids in the first place is having one whoring around. i said to jane i thought she said she didn't care to have kids, but jane said that she feels \"different\" now and this baby is a \"blessing\". i got kind of tired of this, so i told her that she knows full well about mine and will's struggles, and she's acting like she's going to play happy families with some random's baby. i realized what i said was kind of harsh and said sorry, but jane got really upset and ended up leaving. i did try and call/text her back but she hasn't replied. i think she's overreacting and i did apologize, but aita?", "myself (28m) and my gf haley (23f) have been together for 2 years, live together, and have an amazing relationship. however, we come from very different families. her family is pretty traditional, everyone marries, settles down, then has kids. (not to say she firmly believes this is the \"right\" thing to do, though. she had a pretty fucked up childhood, if that's at all relevant). my family is extremely blended, with many divorces and teen pregnancies and kids with various partners. haley has always gotten along really well with my family, they love her and vice versa. she has always accepted the way my family is, but something happened this morning to make me think otherwise.\n\nmy cousin jared (23m) and his girlfriend amy (22f) just had a baby boy september 2019. i should also add that his younger sister, my cousin shania (21f), has 2 boys with two different guys. my girlfriend loves these kids dearly and spoils them. so when jared called this morning to tell me that he and gf are having another baby, i was surprised when haley responded with a stone face and said nothing. i asked her why she didn't seem happy for them and she said: \"jared still owes your grandma thousands of dollars right?\". i said yeah. \"and amy is still waitressing? and smoking?\" (they both smoke cigarettes) i said yeah. she just said k and continued making breakfast. i asked her what that was supposed to mean. she got really agitated all of a sudden and snapped back with \"i'm sorry, i love your family but sometimes their stupid fucking decisions get under my skin. i just hate seeing kids keep having have kids\" then went on to bring up other things about my family having lots of dogs and not training them properly and swearing in front of the kids and how none of my cousins have proper jobs to support their kids and dump them off with grandma all the time and live in trailers. she had never expressed any of this before and i was shocked; it made it seem like she sees my family as inferior and trailer trash.\n\ni've been reflecting on the things she said and yeah, they are true. i guess i've always just seen my family as normal because i'm the son of a teen mom myself. she approached me a couple hours later and said sorry, and that she just really believes that people shouldn't take having babies lightly because her parents had major unsolved issues throughout her childhood, which stick with her to this day. i accepted her apology, but i still feel hurt and bitter about what she said about my family. aita?", "\nmy wife \"lisa\" has been sick for the past couple of weeks. her folks came over to visit (they

\"dad dad!!\" from the kitchen. i head over to the kitchen and see alex and lisa fighting. i ask lisa why she was yelling at alex and she tells me that alex took all the apples my inlaws brought from home and shared them with her friends upstairs. i tell her alex probably didn't know but she tells me that she explicitly told alex not to touch them. i ask alex if that was true and she tells me yes but that she and her friends couldn't find anything else edible. lisa goes over to the fridge and opens it saying the fridge was literally full of snacks and alex did this just to spite her and basically \"steal\" from her. i tell lisa to calm down and that i'd go get her some from the grocery store, lisa replies that those apples are special because they're from her home country and she needed them for her recovery. she goes on to tell me alex intended to do this and so something needs to happen, a punishment should he issued. i tell alex to go upstairs and lisa and i start arguing. i refuse to punish alex because even if what she did was intentional she's a kid and it's typical behavior. lisa starts ranting about how this scenario keeps happening and i never take a stand but i reply that she's just obssessed with having my daughter punished for some reason. she stops arguing now and stares at me. she then walks out and goes to stay with her folks until they'd left.\n\nlater she avoids me and refuses to speak to me. i found this whole thing quite ridiculous because alex is just a kid and so she acts without thinking sometimes but lisa tends to get oversensitive and think

people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. \n\nabout six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years [21m]. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on \"proper\" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. \n\nso the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's \"starting to get annoying\". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there \"skulking around all the time\". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's \"getting ridiculous\". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.\n\nmy potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and i'm trying to make that point. am i really the asshole here?", "i'm a single dad, 43 years old. computer programmer. my son, let's call him jack, is 17 years old. jack's mom died when he was 10, but thankfully

media account, as long as he allowed me to check on it whenever i wanted, which was a privilege i made use of a few times until he turned 15 and i realized i could trust him, having never asked for it since then. he allowed me to know where he stored his account passwords just in case, but i never really looked for them, so his social media and computer activity have been a complete mystery to me in the last couple of years.\n\nhowever, i was always fearful he would try to hide something or get into something dangerous, so i installed a keylogger just in case, always thinking about his safety.

casual conversation regarding privacy and privacy apps and my niece overheard us (they were born the same year). she got offended i would do such a thing, claiming it was a horrible invasion of jack's

shops to try to get diagnosis and medication that aren't necessary. she imposes a lot of odd restrictions on her kids. \n\nwhenever she feels like they're misbehaving, she'll send them out here for a week, driving from out of town &amp; dropping them off with very little warning. i personally haven't seen anything i'd call a behavioral issue, and i'm well informed on the topic. she expects me to enforce all of her weird restrictions which i don't. i'm not into that free range no consequences parenting woo-woo shit but i don't feel like there's any sort of reason to be restrictive with them.

to be \"high-impact\" sports, 3-4hrs of online school everyday, no roughhousing, etc. \n\ni don't impose those restrictions here. they have relatively healthy behaviors even without prompting. even without the restrictions they aren't binge watching tv, they eat relatively healthily, they take occasional naps but sleep well at night, they play sports without overexerting, they do short small chunks of school throughout the day w/o getting behind. they aren't hurting eachother roughhousing and are good with my kids. \n\ni swear, my wife swears, we watch tv that has some language, and they

old. it's been 8 years and she's still grieving, which i completely understand as if i lost either of my sons i'd probably grieve forever, too. she's decided to sell the house and she approached us

offer for her to stay until her flat is totally ready, but she declined.\n\ni like to think my sons are good kids. not angels by any means but well behaved, the 9 year old cleans up after himself, there's no conflict with the boys, and my husband and i rarely have to reprimand either boy (this is mainly about the 9 year old because the 2 year old is 2 and rarely causes issues).\n\nmy sister, however, sees things differently. every time either boy has done anything since we moved in she's had issues. my 2 year old was reading one of his books with sound effects and when he hit a button she yelled at him for making too much noise. she's also yelled at my 9 year old more than once for normal 9 year old things like not wanting to take a bath. and this isn't a light reprimand, this is actual yelling at him with the occasional insult.\n\ntonight he was doing his homework at the kitchen counter under my supervision, my sister walked in and began yelling at him about the \"mess\" (his exercise book and a couple pens/pencils) and saying the kitchen looked like a pigsty. it was at this point i asked to speak to her in another room and tell her that this is not on and she cannot yell at my kids. things escalated quickly from there and she said that \"if you're not going to parent them properly, someone should\" and i responded that \"just because you don't have kids doesn't mean you can parent other peoples'\".\n\nshe went upstairs, packed a bag, and is now staying with our parents. my sons didn't hear but i relayed it to my husband. he agrees with me in principal because he didn't like how she was speaking to the boys, either, but says the way it happened neither of us came off great. my parents called and said that she's with them now, in tears, and that i need to

day with them. we've tried telling them we wanted \"alone time\" for our honeymoon and they shrugged us off saying that's what our room is for. we also tried faking illness to get out of eating with them and they just got room service to our room and sat with us while we faked stomach aches. my husband snapped earlier and said this whole thing was way over the line and they had no right intruding on our honeymoon of all things, and they told us that they paid for this whole thing and that as adults we're allowed to take holidays at the same time to the same place.\n\nwe've been talking and we

that he earned the money himself to cover his expenses, including plane tickets and accommodations, which had come around to be around cad$5,000.\n\ni made this request months ago because i knew he was going to ask his parents for the money to cover the expenses, which they had always given him (like when his brother asked for $3k for a gaming setup and when he asked for $2k so he could have a tv in his room). his family isn't super wealthy, but they are well-to-do. and his mom has tried to ask him to try and get a part-time job during school breaks to which he has always said he'll try but

wedding ceremonies, a catholic ceremony for his family and a ceremony from my culture for my family - my parents will be attending the catholic ceremony and my future in-laws are invited to the cultural ceremony.\n\nmy partner has been extremely helpful, understanding and patient during the planning process. the problem started when we met with the church folks to go over some ceremony basics. the priest (?) gave us a rundown of the words he will be saying and i asked if we could edit them a little. long story short - my ask has resulted in the priest/father (?) refusing to do the ceremony and my in-laws taking back their blessing of our marriage because i\u2019m \u201cdisrespectful to them, their son, their church and their religion\u201d. \n\ni\u2019ll be honest, i have very little knowledge of the inner workings of catholicism aside from what i\u2019ve googled and i\u2019m at a loss over why there has been such a strong reaction. we changed a few things in my culture\u2019s wedding ceremony for my husband so that he is comfortable and that was completely fine with my tribal leaders. i used this example of me accommodating my partner during my cultural ceremony and i expected the same understanding from them. their reaction was not nice so i\u2019ve stopped all communication with them for the last few days.\n\ni\u2019m not even sure what\u2019s happening anymore and i feel like i might have escalated things when i didn\u2019t need to. like, i\u2019m not catholic so maybe i should have not asked to change their ceremony and let it go but also words are power in my culture and we don\u2019t just toss around promises/vows like they don\u2019t mean anything. i also know my parents would not like the wording of the vow the priest expected me to say so that\u2019s a major reason i asked for some changes. my partner has been upset and he\u2019s not really speaking to me, his family or anyone.\n\nidk y\u2019all, let me know if i overreacted

and she\u2019d turn it off, but she doesn\u2019t. \n\nshe gets lots of irritated eye rolls and death glares from passengers. someone even went up to the bus driver, but what could he do, he had to drive the bus.  she also had two kids with her so i think that kept away people who otherwise would\u2019ve confronted her. \n\ni was hoping to take a nap before arriving at my destination and couldn\u2019t drown out this sound. \n\ni went over and asked politely if she could turn that off and she said pretty evenly \u201cno i can\u2019t.\u201d there was about five minutes of back and forth that can be best summarized as \nme: you are bothering everybody and this is wildly inconsiderate \n\nher: you don\u2019t speak for everybody and my kids like the music. i paid for this bus seat and i can do what i want. \n\nso then i did something i\u2019m not proud of. i took the speaker, put it in my briefcase, and set the combination lock. \n\nas a show of good faith, i gave her my briefcase to hang onto for the remainder of the trip, to be clear i was not trying to steal her speaker. i just said, very ticked off at this point \u201ci\u2019ll open it when we get there since you clearly aren\u2019t responsible enough to handle a speaker.\u201d \n\nthey tried to get the bus driver involved but he basically said \u201cstop bothering me while i\u2019m driving or i\u2019ll have to remove you.\u201d \n\ni have a feeling i\u2019m the asshole but also what else was there to do in that situation?", "this sounds really bad but please hear me out. \n\nmy wife is pregnant with our daughter. i'm really excited and happy for us. but my wife is convinced that  i'm cheating on her. she gets these weird dreams where i cheat on her. she wakes me up in the middle of the night to ask me if i still love her. i was really fine with that. i thought the harmones were messing with her.\n\nbut this quickly escalated. she asked me to install a tracking app which i did for her sake. but i get really pissed when she calls me after checking my location to bring her something. for example if i'm near a store, she'll ask me to bring her something from that store. \n\ni'm really fed up with all this drama. wibta if i just told her that she's the most insecure person i've ever met?", "there's around 10 houses in my neighborhood of 120 that are not in the hoa, mine included. we (or previous owners) were smart enough to not join the hoa. as a result, i am able to make extensions and i have a pool, which i host neighborhood parties occasionally. my hoa is one of the worst hoas, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. they're not the worst hoa but they're bad. we also got a shitty neighbor, jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. she prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. i absolutely lost my shit when jessica posted in the next door app about how mrs jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. she obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. the hoa then fined her 500 dollars.\n\ni made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the hoa nor jessica were invited to my bbq at my house. jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and i told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. a couple people said i was bullying and excluding her and

father married my step-sister's (23f) mother when i was 4 and she was 3. we've lived together most of our lives and are a family. she and i were extremely close.\n\nshe developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. she's since made a full recovery. during that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. they also asked a lot of me. i quit my extracurriculars so i could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so i could drive her to appointments. i didn't go to dances and any fun activities i did needed to include her. i did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - i did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. and i think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances.\n\nanyhow, i go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him ben, when i'm a junior. we fall in love, blah blah blah. he and i move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. we were serious until july when i walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister.\n\ni broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. my sister apologized at first but then backed off. i thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. she told me that she and ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. distraught,  i left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. she later venmo'ed me asking for the money.\n\nshe told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with ben. they brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. i don't buy this, in part because i've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that i should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. they then told me that if i don't accept my sister and ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. i reminded them that i'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her.\n\nfor the record: i'm not jealous of her. i'm not upset that ben picked her over me. i'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that i don't want to be with a cheater. what i'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose ben over me. that she slept with ben knowing he and i were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts

that, she then continued to correct me and said \u201cthat\u2019s the tall cup is that the size you want\u201d (obviously that was the size i wanted i just pointed to it) so i just nodded, she then told me one more time that it was called a tall almost talking down to me and i just stood there not really knowing what to do (i think she really wanted me to say tall) we stood there for an awkward

however due to lockdowns etc it had to be postponed to 2022. she has booked 2 weeks off for her wedding and for her honeymoon nearly 2 years in advance and everything is paid for. me and candice work in the same store section (white goods).\n\nnow i had bad eyesight as long as i can remember myself and was finally able to save for an operation. upon the check up the doctor said he operation must happen sooner rather then later. they explained that they can see a small rapture in one of my eyes and they are worried that if i fall down or hit my head or due to stress it will become worth and they won't be able to fix it, which would make me uneligable for an operation. due to this the operation was scheduled for the time of candice wedding.\n\nwhen i have told my boss that i will need 2 weeks off for the same week, they declined my request saying its too short notice and candice already booked it off, so us 2 can't be off at the same time. i had to go through the doctor to have a note issued stating i will be having an operation and due to recovery will not be able to work for those 2 weeks and legally it is not something my boss can decline.\n\nbecause of this and since candice wedding is more then 2 weeks away, he cancelled her holiday request. she can't get any refunds at such short notice and said she will take unpaid leave in this case, however our boss said he won't be granting her any leave as we are understaffed (someone started their maternity leave recently)  and if she won't show up, then they will treat it as anauthotised absence which will lead to dismissal.\n\nduring our shift candice had a go at me and called me a massive asshole for scheduling the operation during her wedding and getting signed off, making her even more stressed before the wedding. some other colleagues believe i'm in the wrong too and should have chosen different dates.\n\naita?", "i (f27) have been with my boyfriend (33) for almost two years now.  we will be getting

made the mistake of going online yesterday and i saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my sisters about how i was a jerk for lying to them about my plans.  \n\ni may have been a little tipsy last night because i decided to respond.  i said that it was ridiculous of them to try and tell me i couldn't share a room with my boyfriend, that i was keeping my promise by not staying at a hotel when we were there, and that if they planned on putting everything on facebook i would be avoiding all visits for the foreseeable future.  \n\nthey took down their posts when people started crapping on them for trying to control me.  but some people did agree with them. \n\nnow they are texting me and calling to say i was an asshole for making them look bad.  i asked them if they were trying to make me look good with their posts?  they stopped for a while but there were more texts and voice mail this morning.   i'm kind of liking the idea of skipping out on the drama from now on. but i miss my dad and he

dark sense of humor that i love, a terrific cook, and overall an amazing woman who i can imagine spending the rest of my life with. she is also on the heavier side, a fact that becomes relevant

standoffish. after that initial meeting i asked a if there was something wrong but she denied it. c made a few more attempts to get to know a but they were all rudely rejected.\n\ne and a both came home for thanksgiving dinner. i asked a to please be polite during the meal since she\u2019s always been rude in her interactions with c even though c has been nothing but gracious in return. the

not accept the relationship and wanted nothing to do with him, and my ex certainly didn't help.\n\nsometimes i had to work the lates. so i had an idea and told jack to basically take her out to ice cream when i was late. while chloe hated him, she wouldn't say no to dessert. so basically he framed it as sneaking ice cream when mum's at work. the bribery worked pretty quickly and she came around to liking him. nowadays she's closer to jack than her father (and even calls jack dad!), and sometimes i think she's closer to him than me.\n\nso chloe is currently 7 months pregnant. she was over yesterday and we were talking about everything. we talked about us as grandparents and i joked that we'll try not to sneak our granddaughter away for ice creams. chloe was surprised, and didn't realise i knew about it. i explained what i said above, and that obviously he's not gonna just take his girlfriends daughter out so often without telling her.\n\nfor some reason chloe got really upset about it. she basically said we lied to her and manipulated her and that i shouldn't think she's 'cheap' to 'buy her love' and invade her privacy and stormed off. i honestly didn't think this would be such a big deal. she hasn't responded to me or jack after she left or today. jack is annoyed with me and says that i didn't have to say anything, though he doesn't seem to know why shes so upset either.\n\nshe got along with him so well, i don't understand why it not being a secret would ruin anything? maybe buying her love wasn't great, but she wasn't giving him a chance. none of it was an

they go to the gym together, they exchange their outfits too. it's pretty frequent too, i even find some of his best friend's boxers and briefs in the laundry. i gently asked him about this and he

about the surname and asking if i knocked her up. following that four more people directly contacted me either congratulating me or asking for confirmation whether it's my child or not and my mother

cooking or give me a chance to prove it, i thought this would change after marriage but 5 months later nothing's changed. what does he eat if he's not eating what i'm cooking? he has requested that his mom send him a meal everyday to eat for dinner after getting off work except for the weekend where we go over to her house and eats breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert there. \n\n\nevery single

came up with an idea. i cooked him the same meal his mom sent him that day and put it aside til he got home. he asked if his mom sent a meal for dinner and i said yes and served him my own version of the meal - not hers. he didn't notice anything different. he ate the whole thing with no hasitation while i sat across from him asking him questions about how good the meal was. he went on and on praising it saying how perfect, exceptional it was, and how it was just what he needed after a long day at work.\n\n\ni smiled and said \"you're welcome\". he froze and looked at me for a minute. looked down at the plate then back at me and said \"wait, you made this didn't you?\" i said \"with my own hand and from scratch\". his face suddenly went red and he got upset and said that this was not cool. i told him he never even gave me a chance to show him how good my cooking is and that he's probably just used to his mom's cooking and is rejecting any other alternatives which's unfair to me. he said that i shouldn't have lied to him and basically tricked him into eating food that he had no idea where it came from. i said he liked it and admitted that it was good so what's the issue. he got up from his seat, threw the napkin and said that i was unbelievable then walked out.\n\n\nhe got quiet the rest if the evening then posted about it on his fb in a vague post about being tricked

time to pick the younger roles in the wedding. her older nephews are junior groomsmen, the younger is the ring bearer. she only has one niece, aubrey, who\u2019s 4. my fianc\u00e9 wants her to be the flower girl. i said that\u2019s fine, but i also want brynn to be one. they can walk down the aisle together, it\u2019d be super cute. brynn loves playing with aubrey,  so they get along.\n\nmy fianc\u00e9 says she wants our wedding to be \u201ctraditional\u201d so there can only be one flower girl. i suggested brynn could hold a sign or something while aubrey threw flowers. my fianc\u00e9 said no, she can sit with my sister and parents.\n\nat this point, i insisted and said brynn would be flower girl. i texted my sister and asked, she agreed. my fianc\u00e9 got pissed and i  said it\u2019s my day too, brynn means a great deal to me and she\u2019ll be in the wedding. my fianc\u00e9e and aubrey\u2019s mom  are mad at me, saying i\u2019m stealing aubrey\u2019s spotlight. aita?",

coworkers, hates poor people and thinks that if you're poor it is purely because you're an idiot, makes derogatory jokes about women and anyone non-white. lots of people try to keep their distance, and it seems he is generally disliked.\n\nmanagement doesn't do anything no matter how many times coworkers complain about his behaviour (and they have), presumably because he works very long hours without asking for extra pay because as he admits he has \"nothing better to do\". he is single, no kids, and has said openly he doesn't really have friends, just work colleagues and some family. i would feel sorry for him if he wasn't nasty to people.\n\nanother coworker, \"sarah\" (about 30) lost her mom to cancer about 2 months ago. i'm not close to sarah but everyone knows it was a really horrible ordeal, and she is sometimes visibly upset in the office.\n\nwhen sarah was visibly upset yesterday, mark said \"jesus she needs to get over it, everyone dies! she's bringing everyone down. she needs to be professional, it's pathetic\"\n\nit was said in a very harsh way. i don't think mark intended sarah to hear but she did, she got upset and left the office (only ended up being for about 20 minutes).\n\ni was sick of mark's terrible comments and said \"for god's sake you're such a dick!! you're just bitter nobody will give a shit when *you* die!\"\n\ni walked away before he could respond. we've been angrily avoiding each other since.\n\ni assume sarah knows what i said because it's the \"office gossip\" right now but i don't know her opinion, though i know mark is pissed. \n\nother coworkers are split. some think mark got what he deserved, others have said that what i said was one of the worst things anyone can ever say, especially as it is likely true because

very much. he regularly takes business trips out of town, and is always under constant stress while working. he usually leaves me in charge of taking care of his dog that he has had for about 10 years, which i don't mind at all. i'd never want something terrible to happen to his pride and joy.\n\nwhile my husband was on a business trip, i noticed that his dog was becoming less responsive and active. i originally brushed it off as him just being tired, but as days went by, he hadn't even moved out of the same spot on the carpet. he didn't even get up to go use the bathroom outside, or eat his meals. every time i called his name out to get him to go somewhere, all he did was open his eyes, slightly lift his head to look at me, only to put it back down and close his eyes again.\n\nwhen this began to happen, i had attempted to call my husband about how the dog was behaving. but i never got an answer after the first few times. the next day i tried to call again. still no answer. i resorted to a text message, telling him i was going to take the dog to the vet the next day, and he should try to catch a flight home just in case our dog doesn't make it home after the visit. because from what i could tell, that looked to be the route it was going. i still hadn't gotten an answer from him.\n\ni sat in the waiting room for hours, still attempting to call my husband. my urgent calls were interpreted by a veterinarian getting my attention to tell me the results of the checkup. she told me that there wasn't any health problems, but rather old age getting to him. she told me there wasn't anything they could do to get him back to 100% again, and told me that our dog probably has another week at best.\n\ni chose to put down the dog.\n\nabout a week later when my husband came home from his business trip, i had to sit him down and explain what happened. of course, neither of us were happy to talk about it. he told me that he didn't have any signal where he was, which is why he didn't respond to any of my messages or calls at all, but told me that is no excuse as to why i should put down his dog. as i tried to explain my panic on the situation, he just began to ignore me, storming off to our room and having me sleep on the couch.\n\nhe has been ignoring me for the past few days. i was only trying to help our dog. and i didn't want to wait for my husband in fear that it would be too late for us to do anything. of course, i tried to contact him in any way i could, but i didn't want my husband to come back to our dog's corpse if he didn't make it. i feel that my

horrible to my daughter. kelly does see how anna treats my daughter, but thinks it's just a phase. my daughter loves to play video games, sports, watch science-fiction movies. anna is the opposite, she is into make-up, wearing dresses and skirts, drama. they are two very opposite people. \n\nmy daughter's birthday is coming up quick and she wants to have a huge party. i was onboard with the idea

not want to have anna at the party. \n\nkelly texted me asking if her daughter was going to receive an invite and i told her that daughter did not want to invite her. kelly called me sobbing asking why she wasn't invited and i told her that the invites were up to my daughter. she then proceeded to accuse my daughter as the reason why kids in school did not like anna and that i was a huge ah for supporting her decision. i told her that the reason why kids in school did not like anna was because of the way she treats them. she hung up on me and we haven't spoken in a few days.\n\naita for not

passing down to a child. \n\nnot to toot my own horn, but once i learned this, i made an effort to start connecting with the deaf community in my area and learn asl. he did not, and while he stayed for the birth, he moved in with his brother right after dropping me off at my home. i own the house, and did before i met him, so it's not part of the divorce. he was nice enough to give me 2 months worth of a cleaning service and a gift card to grubhub. \n\nhe ended up telling everyone that i am the reason he doesn't see our child, and that i filed for divorce because i overreacted.  the truth is that i have sole custody because he cried, in court, that he couldn't \"deal\" with the baby and wanted to just pay support. while i did file, it was because he abandoned me and said so many horrible things that i couldn't get over. \n\ni have text messages he sent me which say that he wouldn't have married me if he knew that we would produce \"problems\" and that he couldn't handle raising a \"r******\" (the only thing wrong with her is hearing). i don't want my child to grow up in a home where she's hated. \n\ni was starting to hear all sorts of crap from my family and his, who started to take his side because divorce isn't really a thing here, so i took action. i made a social media post publishing the text messages so that people would finally see the truth. i'm now

though there was nothing to feel) just overall happy.\n\nmy daughter on the other hand just gave a small smile and said she was happy for us, my daughter has always been a bit apathetic towards most things and my husband took notice of that quickly after they have met and has brought it up to me a few times. noticing her reaction or lack there of my husband let out a groan and said. \"you could at least pretend to be happy, that's what normal people do.\"\n\nmy daughter just looked at him for a few seconds and then left the room without a word. i didn't think much of it until the weekend

refused and tried to leave but i closed the door and told her and my ex she wasn't going. later that night my ex called ranting about how my daughter had called him crying about how she didn't want to live with me and my husband anymore.\n\nshe told him he was mean and drought up the fact that he would often call her 'sophiopath' -her name is sophia - and that i just let him and never stuck up for her. i told him that my husband didn't mean anything by it and that it was all in good fun which is why i didn't say anything. i told my husband about it and told him he needed to apologize for what he said which he did but got visibly frustrated when she just stared at him until he felt to room.\n\nafter the weekend was over my ex brought our son back for school and he asked his sister if she was going to living with their dad from now on. my son adores his sister and i know that if she decides to live with their dad he will too. on monday morning i caught my daughter packing clothes in her back pack, she said her dad was going to pick her up after school and drop her off the next day, since she didn't get to spend the weekend, i told her that she wasn't going to her dad's and that she was staying home from school that day. my daughter called my ex and told him everything and now he's keeps calling saying that we had an agreement and that is she wants to live with him that i

arts track and ended up doing non-profit work after college when i realized i didn\u2019t actually want to be a schoolteacher. just to say that we always assumed he\u2019d out-earn me by a considerable margin, though when he made more i always insisted we split things evenly to avoid potential resentment down the road.\n\ni\u2019ve had sort of a non-linear career path, but ended up switching to the corporate world. to make a long story short, my liberal arts degree and time doing non-profit work gave me a lot of skills that enable me to really excel professionally in some more

been super supportive of my career. but instead he\u2019s started to make increasingly harsh jabs about how i \u201ccheated the system\u201d to get where i am, that no english lit major makes more than a cyber security professional without cheating somehow.\n\nhis major point is that i got my first job out of nepotism, which set me up to \u201ctrample\u201d more qualified people who didn\u2019t have the same advantages. it\u2019s true that i got my first post-college job after being referred by a sorority sister, but it was for non-profit work making 22k/yr, not exactly at somebody\u2019s

about flying the kids here to move in with us. i have never been interested in having kids (i have nothing against kids in general, i just personally don't want to raise or live with any kids), and have always been very clear on that, and i thought my fianc\u00e9e was the same. so i reiterated my stance on having kids, and said i'm not going to change my mind on that now.\n\nmy fianc\u00e9e claims we're the only people who can take in these kids, which seems strange because she has a brother, who has the bonus of living close to where the kids have been living so they wouldn't even have to change schools. my fianc\u00e9e says her brother can't take them because of money and being too busy, though i'm sure he could do it if he really wanted to, i'm pretty sure you get money from the government for taking in orphaned kids if you need financial help. also he's about to inherit a bunch of money from his mom.\n\ni said if my fianc\u00e9e insists on taking in these kids, we will no longer be compatible and we'll unfortunately have to end the relationship and she'll have to move out of my place. she's mad that i'm making her choose between me and the kids, even though there's really nothing else i can do because i simply am not going to take in these kids, i just have zero interest in raising kids. i think it's completely unfair to expect me to upturn my life for 2 random kids i've never even met just because her brother can't be bothered. \n\nshe claims i'm basically saying the kids have to go to foster care or i'll kick her out and leave her with nowhere to go and 2 kids to care for, which is a bit dramatic because again, they have an uncle i bet could take them in with a bit of effort, and if she really must be the one to take them she could just move into her mom's old place or her sister's old place. she's also saying that i'm basically threatening to break up with her and kick her out right after her mom and sister died, but i don't see that i had a lot of choice since she was ready to bring 2 kids into my place, and it was either tell her my stance now or wait until she'd already moved them in.\n\naita?", "&amp;#x200b;\n\ni, 28m, recently was going to have a wedding with my fiance jamie (26m fake name). to spare the details, we met in high school, him being a year younger.\n\nwe are both gay men and love eachother very much. my family has been 110% supportive of my sexuality and our relationship, they have known for over a decade now. however, jamie was raised in a conservative, heavily christian, anti-everything-that-goes-against-common-republican-agenda, family, opposite to mine. if you couldn't tell by now, his family is and was not supportive of him.\n\nregardless of their support, we continued on and eventually got engaged 2019 christmas, just before corona. we decided to have it just this june as covid had calmed down by then and wasn't such a risk to our families.\n\npreparations went as planned and it was going to turn out just as we had dreamt our wedding would be. now, i should've mentioned earlier, i am black. my fiance is white. so during the planning period of the wedding, jamie's family were making rude comments specifically towards my heritage and my family. due to guildelines i won't be mentioning any details or examples of things they've said.\n\njamie had made arrangements to completely cut his family off from him after we had gotten married, which is why i hadn't clapped back or anything and completely put up with the comments his family had made.\n\nflash forward, time for the wedding, 21st june, everything is going perfect, as we were about to seal the deal and the priest said the classic rendition of \"anyone who objects speak now or forever hold your peace\". jamie's cousin stands up and shouts \"i object! i don't want my cousin marrying a \\_\\_\\_\" honestly it felt like a scene from a racial movie. of course, i saw red, my family did too. right in the middle of the cathedral we decided to hold the ceremony in, an argument broke out eventually resulting in me screaming something along the lines of, \"i cant do this, i'm sorry\". and left. i can't really remember as the stress had my head clouded.\n\ni powered my phone off for the night and went to go stay in a hotel. i woke up to hundreds of voicemails and texts berating me saying i had ruined jamie's night, both from him, his family, and my family.\n\ni met with jamie the next day and he said i could've just ignored it and that i'm an ah

haven't seen games of thrones yet, i was looking forward to binge watch the first season. i made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. an hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that i need to turn it off immediately. a little bit confused, i asked why. she told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. while i agree with that, i told her that i'm not going to turn it off. she then basically told me that i am an

follows.\n\nme: \"here's the deal. i not only don't want kids of my own, but i would never even be willing to take in nieces, nephews, or other family. i don't mind visiting, kids over for a weekend/day trip, but even if we were the best family to take in a child, it is a deal-breaker and divorce-worthy.\n\nher: \"i understand, we are on the same page. you don't have to worry about it.\"\n\nnow, the issue is that this exact thing happened. my wife's sister and brother in law were sent to prison for manufacturing and selling drugs. our six-year-old niece now needs a new home.if we take her in, she can go to the same school. but due to circumstances, she's not even in school right now. she does have some kindergarten friends.\n\nthere are two viable options for my niece. a, live with us.  b, she lives with her grandparents across the country. the grandparents are wealthy, loving, very healthy, in their late fifties, and adore their granddaughter. they are willing to take her in.\n\ni was talking to my wife casually about how the niece is going to love having a big yard at their grandparents, and she flipped out on me. she started calling me cold, unloving and said that my niece needs to live with us. that we cannot abandon her and that my wife would be devastated if she couldn't see the niece every week. she said it is cruel to remove her from her friends. (but she's only six, she could adjust?? parents relocate all the time). my wife is also saying that we will be letting her down by not taking her in.\n\ni told her that while i understand, we had multiple discussions about this exact thing before and after getting married. i eventually told her this.\n\n\"i understand how much you care for your niece. i won't stop you from doing what your heart says is right, but as we discussed, we will be getting a divorce.\"\n\ni was calm, polite, never yelled at her, and told her i would support her in divorcing me and taking in her niece if that's what she wants.\n\nshe won't talk to me now, and my parents think i am a massive asshole. however, her parents, the grandparents of the niece, are actually on my side. they knew about my no child policy and want to take her in.\n\nwe could financially support her and give her space. but she will objectively have more with the grandparents. they have a nicer home, live in a woodsy/lovely area,

she wouldn\u2019t lose the alimony payments. when dad met my mom, his ex threw a fit because mom came from a poor family/wasn\u2019t white, and according to his ex, she was a gold-digging whore because she was pregnant before they got married.\n\nmy mom died when i was young and we struggled for money between the payments dad was making and his injuries/lack of education making it hard for him to get a job. my half-brothers were really well-off from his support payments and the money from their mom and her \u201cclose friend\u201d she was living with. whenever they stayed with us, they

their relationship except when she texted me last week i saying she would love to hang out but thinks it\u2019ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. i asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of \u201cauditioning\u201d to prove she was with him for the right reasons. she went on to say that my brother is paranoid she\u2019s after his money so he would test her like 1. leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she\u2019s not going out with him for money 3. never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn\u2019t. \n\n\n\ni was shocked so i had to hear my brothers perspective. we spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. he said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. i asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could\u2019ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. he said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn\u2019t bought her a single gift since they\u2019ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. \n\n\nhe confronted her and said he thinks she\u2019s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. he\u2019s upset about the \u201cgold digging bitch\u201d and when i laughed he called me an asshole. he said i would never understand what\u2019s it\u2019s like being a rich man and being used and i get that concern, but i told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he\u2019s delusional as hell. if he doesn\u2019t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he\u2019s not going to be genuine in his relationships

didn't.\n\n\nthis happened 2 years ago, he now moved back with my inlaws and we'd see him more often. he tried to comment on how i dress on multiple ocassions and it's unbearable. but since my inlaws said he's struggling and depressed then i let it go.\n\non friday my inlaws celebrated my husband's 30th birthday at their home. i wore a heart-shaped blue dress and had my hair up. while we were eating my bil pointed at me and said that my cleavage was showing and that i shouldn't have wore this dress because it looked inappropriate for a family gathering. i was utterly shocked, everyone was staring at me and i felt so embarrassed and on the spot. he looked at me waiting for me to blow up probably but i laughed and told him \"knock, knock! he said \"who\u2019s there?\", i said \"nana\". now he paused and seemed confused at the mention of this name. he then faked a laugh and said \"nana who?\" i said \"nana your goddamn business what i\u2019m wearing! ok!\". he got upset and quickly left the table. my sils laughed but my husband and his parents were upset and later said that i was way out of line for bringing up nana to my bil knowing how heartbroken and depressed he is because of her. his mom said that i was petty and didn't need to dig at him just to prove a point.\n\n\nmy husband thinks i'm in the wrong as well and that i was being deliberately hurtful by bringing up

someone to stay with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted.\n\n\nhe told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but i don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while i work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a pilot) and paid child care is a no for me. my son said i shouldn't be surprised by him trying to work to save money to be able to pay for himself but that is just absurd since he literally lives with us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. he said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. we kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a \"like it or not\" attitude

struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly.\n\n\neta okay, it seems that i did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything.\n\neta okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that i'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. he doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. he adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. also, my husband said the girls are too

minimalist (and i think stylish tbh) staples. \n\nthere's a woman in my office (late 30's) who mostly wears clothing from hot topic, lots of nightmare before christmas stuff, tights with cats/other large patterns, lacy and corset like items. she's made some remarks in the past about how she often sees me in the same few outfits, or how i often repeat things. usually i just ignore them or brush them off but i have to be honest i was already in a salty mood when i ran into her in our kitchen. \n\ni was wearing an outfit i wear fairly regularly (oversize white button down, black jeans, black boots)\n\nme: hi (coworker)\n\nher: hi op\n\nme:\\*begins making my cup of tea\\*\n\nher: wearing the same thing again, have you thought about mixing it up? \n\nme: no, i'm pretty happy with my wardrobe as is\n\nher: continues to talk about how i should really add some color and pattern to my wardrobe, and how my clothes right now are so boring. \n\nme:(probably being an asshole) well some of us just prefer dressing like adults. \n\ni walked back to my desk after that and found out later that she'd emailed my boss (who is her boss's, boss's boss) that i had been hostile to her and was thinking about making a complaint to hr (i told my boss my side of what happened and we're all good, but i'll probably have to talk to our hr rep to give my side). \n\ni know i probably should have just walked away, but i want to know, was i the ah here?", "i don\u2019t have anything against him as a person. however, i am concerned that my daughter (21f) does not know what she\u2019s getting into with this relationship and it frightens me that they are talking seriously about marriage. \n\nher boyfriend (i\u2019ll call him \u201ctom\u201d) has a genetic disease that causes him to have extreme muscle weakness and limited motor skills. \n\ni\u2019m not a doctor so my understanding of his disease is that of a layperson, but i do know the following things. he is wheelchair bound. he needs help showering and even using the toilet. she literally has to hold him up on the seat the whole time he\u2019s using it or he will fall over. also, the limited use he has of his arms means that he even has to be spoon or hand fed. and obviously my daughter will be prepping and cooking every meal. anyway, as you can see, his limitations are extreme and, as far as i know, he is not ever going to get better in this regard.\n\nthey hardly ever go out on real dates as tom prefers the comforts of his home. a date to them is my daughter wheeling him around in the park or at the mall. on the rare occasion when they do go out to eat or something, my daughter has told me people generally assume she is his caretaker and they get tired of correcting them. tom is also very small (particularly his legs), and people frequently mistake him for a child. \n\nmy concern is that my daughter is living the life of an old woman nursing an aging husband. yet they are both in their twenties! my daughter tells me they can have children but i imagine it would have to be via artificial insemination. i haven\u2019t asked too many questions about that because she gets uncomfortable, which i can understand.   \n\nwhat i do know is that they will never be able to live even a semi-normal existence as a couple. up until a year and a half ago tom lived with his mother, who was his caretaker. since he and my daughter have gotten an apartment together though, my daughter has taken over bathing, feeding, and toileting him. her only break seems to be when she goes to class, during which time tom has a day nurse that stays with him. \n\ni know that some people may think i\u2019m an awful person for feeling this way, but i can\u2019t help but feel concerned about what my daughter is signing up for. she is a sweet and gentle girl but i worry that she is also a quite na\u00efve and idealistic. i don\u2019t think she\u2019s considered what life will be like for her years down the road when her 20s are behind her. \n\nanyway there is a lot more i could write about all of this but i think i\u2019ve laid out the basics. aita?", "my son is 17 and a junior in high school. he got his license

getting to know her, attending online therapy with a lgbt counselor that our daughter paid for, and just overall trying to be a loving presence in our daughter's life. it's a process and my husband

parade, things have been pretty smooth up until now. my husband has drawn a hard line about attending the wedding. i was sort of on the fence about attending, but i decided to stick with my husband.

and that she would not want us to be a part of her life.\n\nagain the counselor spoke up for us and told our daughter that everyone had their hard boundaries (boundaries that they would absolutely not cross) and that instead of making ultimatums, it would be better to consider the overall picture rather than letting one moment be the deciding factor of the relationship.

eventually made up thirty years down the line, but that was thirty years of memories that they both had missed out on. yet, when she talked to her parents about it recently, they said that even as much as it had hurt them not to go, they would have made the same choice because it was just something that they strongly disapproved of. she ended by telling me that she wasn't going to tell me to go

token, i should be continuing to wear condoms despite having had a vasectomy. after shouting at me for 10 minutes, they just left. my wife has been incredibly mad with me and demanded i apologize to them, but i refuse to apologize for caring about their health and safety. i don't see how what i did was this horrible. they could have just declined the condoms. and their arguments are ridiculous.

give-and-take.  that stuff is totally fair to me.  he's also brought up that he'd like me to split the mortgage payments down the middle, but i don't feel like that's fair.\n\nthe biggest issue is that i don't feel comfortable paying half of the mortgage payments for a house that isn't mine.  if we broke up, he would keep the money i put into the house and i would have nothing to show for it.  he bought the house himself so i feel like he already committed to making those payments himself off his own income, plus me splitting bills should make his monthly expenses a little less, too.\n\nhe's uncomfortable with this and has tried to frame it like paying rent but it's not rent, it's a house that be in his name and he will own one day and it feels like a power dynamic where i move in, sleep with him and help pay off his house, so if we break up it's all a win/win for him and i'm left with nothing.  besides, it's not a place i would choose to live because it's double the commute to work every morning compared to where i live now.  plus, i just moved into my apartment two years ago so all my furniture is relatively new and all my own, but he's already furnished his place and is happy with it as-is so i'd have to give away/sell all my furniture for a fraction of what i just paid for it.  it feels like i'm at the losing end of everything here, and even if he tries to frame it as paying rent, it's still a crappy deal.\n\ni pointed out that if we think of it like rent then it's his job to shovel the driveway and take care of the yard, and that he'll have to take care of/pay for all repairs and maintenance, etc.  he got upset and felt i was just being spiteful/petty but i feel like he's missing the point.  ultimately, i feel like he committed to buying the house and for me to pay half of that is not fair on me when we aren't getting a 50/50 split of the house in the big picture.  aita?", "i won't be going into specifics, since i'd rather avoid being

the question.\n\nearlier today, i was boarding my flight with my friends, since we're all going on vacation together. as i'm boarding, i find that one of the passengers is boarding with a golden retriever, with a guide dog vest on it. i want to make it clear that i'm not questioning whether this was a guide dog or not. this was also a fairly small plane, since the flight would only take around an hour. as mentioned, i cannot be in a confined space with a dog. i told one of the flight attendants my concerns, since i could have potentially ended up in hospital if i had to fly with this dog. the flight attendant informed the woman with the dog, who goes into hysterics, saying that she is visiting a sick family member, and can't afford to miss her flight. i'm not sure how sick the family member in question was/is. the flight attendant asked if i'd be willing to miss this flight and catch the next one that would be leaving in around 2 hours. i was offered a seat in first class if i was willing to do this. i said that unfortunately i wouldn't be able to do this, since i'd paid for my vacation. due to the size of the plane, the dog would not be able to go in the hold. the woman started insulting my character, saying that i was \"heartless\" for putting my vacation over her sick family member.\n\ni got on the plane and sat with my friends. as i did this, a woman in a nearby seat told me that she wanted to inform that i \"am the biggest bitch that she's ever met.\" i didn't respond since i didn't want to cause a confrontation. my friends haven't said i'm in the

friends with carly for two years longer than that. i suspect that carly has feelings for jake, but he has never had feelings for her. i've never been thrilled about their friendship, but i trust my husband and have total confidence that he would never cheat. \n\na year ago, carly moved into our neighborhood. she lives alone, and she picked up the habit of asking jake to help her with house work and maintenance. when her water heater broke, she called jake. when she needed help setting up a tv, she called jake. when her trees needed trimming, she called jake. etc. etc. you get the idea. \n\njake and carly also work near each other downtown, and a few days a week she'll ask him for a ride to work when she doesn't \"feel like driving.\" she's also started dropping by our house unannounced, usually when she's having a bad day and wants to vent to jake about it. she relies on him heavily for emotional support 24/7. \n\nwhile i've tried to be patient and respectful of my husband's friendship with her, i have become less and less tolerant of carly in the past few months as i feel she's become a constant presence in our marriage. \n\nthe final straw came yesterday. as a medical worker, i've been pulling insanely long hours at the hospital. yesterday i finally had a day off and i was very excited to spend some time with jake. just after breakfast, he received a text from carly asking if he can help her move some furniture around because she decided to redecorate. he told her he can't because it's my day off and we're spending the day together. she then calls him and explains that it shouldn't take more than an hour, and her living room is a mess and she really could use his help getting things in order. at this point, i snapped. i took the phone and told her that jake had said no and she needs to respect that he wants to spend time with me, his wife. when she started to argue, i said \"i'm sorry carly but i think it's time for you to find your own husband,\" and hung up. \n\njake was shocked and thought that i was far too harsh. he thinks that i should have some compassion and said \"how would you feel if you were 35 and alone and without many friends? i feel sorry for her.\" at that, i questioned whether or not i was actually in the wrong here. reddit, aita?", "i moved from georgia to the pacific northwest last year for a dream job after i graduated college. it was a little bit of a culture shock, because i went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. there hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. for example, every white woman i meet mentions beyonce to me within the first five minutes. when i was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'so... beyonce.'\n\nso the problem in the post title is that i am the only black woman at my office, and i am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and i'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. my name is tina, short for christina. pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. for some reason, a handful of people at work call me tiana, tiara, or tia, i think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. i am most often called tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which i think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. the other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position i'm in) used to work there and i get called her name (mary) sometimes too. sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, \"how do you pronounce that?\" it's tina!\n\ni have tried politely correcting this and i correct it immediately every time. from polite, \"just for the record, my name is tina!\" to lighthearted, \"tina, like tina belcher!\" in e-mails from me that say tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, i still get, \"thanks tiana!\" sooo... i'm considering doing the twitter approach, where i just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. like:\n\nchuck: thanks, tiana\n\ntina: no problem, chad!\n\njessica: hi tiara!\n\ntina: good morning, jennifer!\n\nwould i be the asshole if i did this? i know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and i feel really disrespected by

katy better. i offered our spare room up so that everyone could drink. after a couple of drinks in katy asked to use the bathroom. when she came out of the bathroom she was holding one of my girlfriends eyeshadow palettes that she had accidentally left in there while rushing to get ready and was raving about how long she had wanted it. without thinking i said she could take it considering jade has an extensive collection and probably wouldn\u2019t miss it. jade didn\u2019t say anything but i could tell by her look that she was fuming. \n\nwhen everyone went off to bed jade confronted me and told me off for offering up her palette. i told her if it was that big of a deal i could buy her a new one. this made her more upset and she said that it was a limited edition palette so that couldn\u2019t happen and demanded i ask for it back. i said no because to ask for the item back is weird and that i\u2019d buy her a similar one. this happened saturday night and it\u2019s thursday

it needed more salt and i told her to add it, but not use the big salt shaker we have, because too much comes out of it. she used it anyways and oversalted the dish. i was really angry and tried to fix it with more mayo but it just didn't taste good. i told my mil that i would have to order a new pasta salad from a local place, which she said wasn't necessary but i did anyways. about 15 minutes

asks \"why should i pay him\". so i have to expain that because she ruined the pasta salad she has to pay for the new one. she finally gets up to pay him but it's incredibly awkward and my wife is

this singer so i asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. i said i can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. she said she'd love to go, but only as friends. she says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. she told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. i said i'll think about it. i was quite hurt because honestly i don't have much experience with rejection, and i was annoyed that she turned me down. \n\ntoday, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. she immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. still, i'm taking her out for drinks on friday. but just now, the friend who i asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. i told her honestly that i already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.\n\nwhen i told my sister about what happened, she said i'm being really douchy. she says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and i should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. i said she can't understand because she's not a dude. because let's me honest, if i had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my \"friend\" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously i'm taking the second one. aita for just being honest about what i want?\n\n**edit**: because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: yes i would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. nowhere do i even say that we have to share a bed...\n\nbut the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. she likely said she\u2019ll go with me as

answered that the hardest thing i'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where i knew no one. we were all ready to move on, but matt immediately piped up and said, \"wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life.\" \n\neveryone got quiet. now, if he had said it jokingly, i probably would have let it go and moved on. however, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and i will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. instead of letting it go, i said \"well, the hardest thing i've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the icu and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when i was 17. i just didn't want to bring the mood down.\"\n\nif things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. after my friends all left, my friend who had brought matt texted me and told me i was a jerk for making matt look bad,

how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to

grade in two weeks. i'm excited, both for him to be able to spend time with other kids and for me to have more time to focus on my other two. last year, we had problems with his teacher calling him alex and encouraging the other children to do it too. i told her not to, and it didn't seem to be a problem which i was thankful for.\n\non wednesday, i went to one of those required orientations where we (my husband and i) met the new teacher and learned about the curriculum. everything was great, and at the end she talked to everyone individually for any concerns. i brought up that she should only call my son by his full name or sasha, which we call him at home, and that referring to him as alex isn't acceptable unless it's a genuine mistake. that's not the name we gave him, so i feel it's reasonable to require. she looked confused, acting somehow offended, like i inconvenienced her by asking her to refer to my son by his name and nothing else. i wasn't being hostile, i just told her to call him what was written on his papers, either aleksandr or sasha. i didn't ask her to correct the other kids, only that she made an attempt to use the right names.\n\nmy husband says i was being unreasonable and need to let go of my attachment to the name because nobody uses it where we live now, and that kids might take it as a bullying opportunity because kids can be cruel. to me it's more important than that because it's the name i chose, and it has some cultural significance to me, so i'm not going to move on it. if i wanted a son named alex (or more likely alexey), that's what i would have named him.\n\naita?", "so christmas is my house is pretty simple. i and my wife buy our kids 2 gifts each, and we accept gifts from aunts and uncles for our kids and place them under

just so i could feel a little happier this christmas.. she said that she would think about it if she has enough gift money after buying gifts for our kids and her parents. well after thanksgiving i knew she wasn't getting me a gift this year again and after i bought our kids my gifts i realized that i had some spare cash over 700 bucks. so i decided to look online and ordered myself a ps5. i wanted to gift it to myself but in reality, i was gone make it a house gift. however, after i got the system and wrapped it under the tree. my wife wondered what it was because i hadn't told her yet and i wanted it to be a surprise. she instead got pretty pissed off at me because she said i was wasting money just to feel important for no reason. i told her that i was going to make the ps5 a house gift i just wanted it to feel like a gift for me since i barely get them anymore. she told me that i needed to stop acting like a child and grow up. i told her that she should've just gotten me a gift

then waits for all the bubbles to fizz out before drinking any of them. it\u2019s just such a waste since she\u2019s essentially drinking regular water at this point but for such a higher price. my wife always argues that it just tastes fresher and crisper after being left out opened.\n\ni normally do the grocery shopping and last week when i went i did not but any seltzer. when i got home my

anything.\n\nlater that day, i went to the gym and when i got back, our kitchen was decked out with seltzer cans. i could barely open the pantry because there were so many packs of seltzer (there were at least 25 boxes worth). my wife smugly told me that she had taken several trips to the grocery store because 1 trip wasn\u2019t enough to fit all the seltzer in her car now that she knew i was

introduced her to gymnastics.  she was totally hooked and kept asking for more and more lessons. we encouraged her, thinking she will eventually lose interest. now she is 12, training 20 hours a week, spending weekends after weekends competing at high level competitions.\n\nproblem is, she is 5'7 already and still growing. she is starting to have ambition for d1 scholarship, or even olympics. that makes me very worried. being 5'7 basically kills her chance of going to the olympics. d1 gymnastics scholarship is already rare, the odds of her getting one with her height is even more rare.\n\nit makes me feel bad that our daughter is very, very dedicated. she's almost always the first one at the gym and the last one to leave. she watches replays of her routine on our drive to training, turns down social events because she \"needs to train\", does extra conditioning at home.\n\nyet i cannot justify blowing thousands of dollars a year and hundreds of hours in time every year to gamble on something with so little chance of success. all the hours spent at her training, driving her to competition is already causing our family life to suffer.  she under-rotates her skills because of her height, and gets injured more frequently than others.  her academics are suffering because of her gymnastics commitment.  her life is going in the wrong direction because of gymnastics.  the bandaid is better ripped off earlier than later.  my husband agrees.\n\ni broke the news to my daughter. frankly, it breaks my heart to tell her to give up something she has worked so hard for. i told her i know she is a hard worker. she would get much better reward if she channels her hard work elsewhere, like in school, or another sport. hell, she plays tennis with the family only casually, yet she was able to win a few u12 tournaments locally. if that's not talent, i don't know what is!\n\nneedless to say, she did not take that well. she cried and cried and cried, locking herself in her room, refusing to eat, saying maybe if she doesn't eat, she will become shorter. i told her over and over that i love her, and i just want the best for her, but she wouldn't have any of it. i tried to reason with her - telling her chasing a \"dream\" is a privilege, not a right.  no use!  my husband has now softened even though we used to have an agreement. our family is now phoning us to try to persuade us to let her continue training, even offering support for training cost and pickup / drop-offs.\n\nif she has the right body type to be an elite gymnast, or if she is tall like she is, but is not struggling because of her height, i would support her unconditionally. however that is not the case! sometimes i feel like giving in, but to think it through, i was the person who drove her to training and competition, i am the breadwinner who paid for her training.  it should be my right to call it off, especially as a parent.\n\nhelp me out reddit. am i the wrongs???", "hi reddit!

passed away from a motorcycle accident. derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  i've seen tons of pictures and videos of connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. it's safe to say that derek and i grew a strong bond in no time. but my son leo isn't close to derek. understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. leo and derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'advice'. derek never complained so i had to step in and tell leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding conner and his memory. leo would say \"ok i get it\" and \"i won't do it again\".\n\ndays ago, leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked derek if he wanted to join. derek agreed and put on connor's hoodie before going out. leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but derek insisted on wearing it or not go. leo dropped it.\n\nhours later derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. he said leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. i was furious i asked leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. i reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said \"so what, maybe this will help him move on in life\". i told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.\nhe pitched a fit

instead.\n\nbut i said no, i agree with her that it's illogical. let's say the property is worth 200k when my mom passes away, 4 ways that's 50k each, 3 ways that's 67k each. if we were talking about $200 i'd understand, but i can't justify taking 17k from each of my kids' futures for a symbolic gesture. obviously the exact amount will depend on the market, 200k is just a reference point/current value.\n\ni told my brother that i didn\u2019t think that was fair to my kids, he said i was being mercenary. aita?", "throwaway.\n\nmy wife's friend, \"lucy,\" came to stay with us for two weeks. she

her mum. \n\nlucy seems to hold old-fashioned, traditional views on ideas of modesty, femininity and sexuality. imagine her surprise when she finds a pole dancing pole in our basement. elle isn\u2019t a professional pole dancer/performer by any means. she just likes it - and she's damn good at it too. when lucy saw the pole, she immediately asked elle if she's a prostitute or a \"slutty stripper.\"  elle denied this, explained that she likes the art of it and it's great for staying fit etc. \n\nlucy, for whatever reason, didn't believe her. she would make comments about elle\u2019s outfits like, \"of course you would wear something revealing to go shopping,\" or \"do you serve your \"clients\" food like this?\" or \"your mother would be so disappointed in you becoming a whore.\" elle didn't say anything (and didn't want me to) but it's clear that those comments hurt (especially those about her mum.) i asked lucy to stop many times, but i think she just resorted to making comments when i wasn't around.\n\none night, i came home to find lucy screaming at elle. she was calling her a whore, a disappointment to her mum, a disgrace for not attending her mum's funeral (she couldn't because of covid) and that she should go back to \"working on the streets.\" elle was silent, so i stepped in and tried to calm her down. it took a few minutes, but once she was somewhat calm, i told her to leave. lucy got mad and claimed that \"i was making her sleep on the streets with the rest of elle clientele.\" this comment made me roll my eyes and laugh a little bit, so i said yes. \n\nit took another hour to get her to finally leave.\n\nthe next morning, elle woke up to many, many missed phone calls and texts from lucy and other family members, calling her names etc. her brother called me, saying that though lucy may be terrible, we had to deal with it if she wanted a decent relationship with her family.\n\nelle blocked lucy and some other family members, but is considering letting lucy

fed up and i told him if he didn\u2019t leave me alone, i would go inside and cause a scene on purpose. i thought he would leave me alone after that but he just went inside to tell my husband what i said. they both came outside and my husband asked me what the problem was and when i explained he was irritated at both of us and told me i better not make a scene and lectured us about how the day

would still exist in 2020. he was adamant that for environmental reasons that it would either be regulated out of existence or all fish would all be dead. i disagreed and we made a wager that if sushi was still widely available by 2020 he would owe me a $1,000 sushi dinner and if not i'd owe him a $1,000 steak dinner.\n\na few weekends ago we were at a wedding of a mutual friend and while waiting for dinner to be served i made an offhand comment about how pretty soon i'll be dining on the finest sushi his money can buy. his wife was with us at the table and i went on to explain the bet to her and how once 2020 hits i am owed a $1,000 sushi dinner. she did not take this well and now he is trying to use that as an excuse to not pay up.\n\nshe was outraged that my friend/her husband was going to \"blow\" $1,000 of their money on a dumb bet. the way i see it is it's $1,000 of his money since we made this deal years before they even met. i might add that she is well aware of our history of dumb bets like when i had to buy him a bottle of wine from his year of birth because i weighed more than him after we did competitive dieting for a summer. \n\nwhile i'd love a fancy $1,000 sushi dinner i'm not a total jerk here. i'd happily settle for just a nice omakase sushi dinner with a bottle or two of sake. to me the bet is more about having a nice dinner with my friend and not having to pay for it and i'm not going to lie some bragging rights. however in his view since this bet predates his marriage if his wife isn't okay with the cost then it's invalidated. \n\naita for expecting

i had to tell her no. she really pushed me for a reason, and i told her her son smells like ass and i basically can\u2019t be around him until he works on his cleanliness. she sent me a text later

about 1 to 2 seconds to begin speaking after i speak, and especially if i count over 5 seconds, then probably that is confusion or surprise i believe. my brother said he wasn\u2019t sure if i was attempting a joke and he should laugh or if i was confused, that's what he was thinking in the pause. the family likes to tease me because when i learned about sarcasm in 1st grade i then tried it out

on august 25th. when he started planning the bachelor party, i told him that planning something earlier in the summer would give him a higher chance of going for the full weekend.  i originally framed it as not wanting to be stuck watching our toddler by myself for a full weekend in my third trimester \n while he\u2019s out golfing, which was a mistake. i should have framed it as not wanting him to go away for a weekend so close to my due date. \n\nthey finally picked a date for the bachelor weekend. it\u2019s august 8th - so i\u2019ll be almost 38 weeks pregnant and considered full term

previously golf weekends, he has been terrible about keeping his phone charged and it can be hard to get in touch with him.  also, while he doesn\u2019t drink, he does smoke pot, and would most likely be smoking the whole weekend. \n\nhe thinks that as long as he gets someone to watch our toddler while he\u2019s gone, it\u2019s fine to go for the full weekend (2-3 nights). this makes me incredibly nervous. i am willing to compromise and agree to an overnight plus a day of golf.  i would also want him to keep his phone on and charged at all times, and ask that he stay sober in case i go into

herself, maybe on one or two occasions out of the two years and thousands of meals we have had together. she isn't perse selfish with her food but she doesn't like to share with me all of the time. which i just kind of find rather annoying considering she does not finish all of her food. for example, if we are out to eat usually i will reach my hand over and try to sample a bite while her food is hot and fresh because i want a taste. she will sometimes smack my hand away and tell me to wait. then an argument always ensues because she thinks i should \"give her the courtesy of at least trying to finish her meal before i touch it\" which is annoying to me because i know she won't finish it and she knows i like my food scalding hot. i usually won't even eat it if it's room temperature.\n\nthe reason i'm asking if i'm ta here is that this weekend we went to a fair in our town and she got a basket of three fried oreos and when she brought it over i took one and she got really upset saying \"you know i wait for these all year round and i wanted to eat all of them!\" which was probably a lie but she seemed kind of upset for the rest of the night about it. i'm pretty

she was profoundly deaf, and at first we immediately considered a cochlear implant as our next course of action for her. my wife and i are both hearing and assumed it would be best to at least give her a chance to be \"hearing\" in a predominantly hearing world, but a friend of mine suggested getting some perspective from a few hard of hearing individuals before we made our decision. we joined a few fb groups and also met with a few representatives from a local school for the deaf and just tried to learn about the deaf community and deaf culture.\n\nit opened our eyes and my wife and i both came to the decision to wait off and wait until our daughter could choose for herself whether or not she wanted the surgery, and in the meantime we have started learning asl in preparation for when our daughter is ready. it was towards christmas when we made our decision, and around the same time my parents asked to meet with us before christmas. we were out to eat just the 4 of us when my parents handed us a card. inside was a beautiful and heartfelt letter explaining that our parents wished to pay for our daughter to have the surgery with some of their saved retirement.\n\nwe were touched by their offer, but then i had to explain to them that we had decided not to go forward with the cochlear implant, which we had told them and the rest of our family by then. my parents said that they assumed we had put off the surgery due to the cost because we had mentioned that our insurance wasn't covering it fully. it was still covering a good amount, but we would still need to pay around $10,000 ourselves when it was all said and done. i again thanked my parents, but told them that it wasn't due to the money and explained our process for how we came to the decision.\n\nmy parents were very upset. they feel like they won't be able to connect with our daughter as well if she were to get the implants. they don't want to sacrifice the time they have with their granddaughter and also said we were putting the entire family in difficult positions by expecting them to learn asl rather than to let our daughter get the surgery. i told them that our daughter could still choose to get the surgery when she was older, and yes it would be more difficult for her then than it would be now before she has started to really develop, but she could still learn.\n\nthis whole thing has caused a substantial rift in our family. a lot of our relatives understand my wife and i's reasonings, but also see it as selfish to completely disregard our parents generous offer. i haven't seen much of my family and it ruined our holiday and even now my parents are holding out and insisting every time we see them to take them up on their offer. i've tried to explain to them that

they are 9f, 7f, and 4m.  for the most part, my husband is a loving father and he absolutely dotes on our girls.  our son is another story.  he is very sensory sensitive, and the littlest of things can set him off like a scratchy shirt tag or an extreme temperature.  i have tried to educate myself on sensory issues and make accommodations for him, but my husband is not willing to do so. he thinks that i baby him and enable his \u201cbad behavior.\u201d  there have been times my husband has insisted i force our son to stay outside despite his obvious discomfort in the heat or make him take his shoes off at the beach even though sand overwhelms him.  both times resulted in total meltdowns.  last weekend, we took a family trip and it was the last straw.  my husband had our girls in the pool, and he was tossing them in.  they were laughing and having a good time.  my son was in the shallow end with just his lower legs in the water, and my husband thought it would be funny to sneak up behind him and push him into the water.  he was wearing a life vest, but the sudden feeling of his head going underwater and his hair becoming wet was too much for him.  he was wailing and i had to get him out of the pool.  he had a complete meltdown that lasted for over thirty minutes. i took him back to the hotel room to calm him down, and my husband told me i shouldn\u2019t have done that.  he said that he will never toughen up and stop being a baby if i keep running to his rescue.  he yelled at our son for embarrassing him at the pool and refused to allow him ice cream later with the girls.  i was furious at his behavior so i got on facebook and ranted about all the times our husband has favored the girls and made our son feel unloved.  now his mother and sisters are mad at him, and he\u2019s pissed at me for putting our private life on facebook.  aita for publicly shaming my husband on fb for how he treats our son?", "i am a nurse practitioner and i am the primary care

grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. \n\nthe subject gets changed very fast.  after supper my parents told me that i should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  i told them that if i heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life i would make sure to keep bringing up the fact that my mom

later died (no adoptive family). as an adult, i've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. my late husband and older son died in a car crash.\n\nmy daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. i tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. so, i did it.\n\nsome of them, like her father and my son, i have actual information for aside from that they're dead. but for most of my family and her paternal family, i literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.\n\nit was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures i have of any ancestors are just headstones. i made a trip when my husband and i first married to take pictures of the headstones, so i included those in there. i only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where i could only label maybe 3 people. i don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but i put some of the old ones in there too.\n\nso while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. now i'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. they're appalled that i allowed such a \"morbid\" report and are saying i traumatized their children. i don't think i did anything wrong. they wanted a report on her biological ancestors, i gave it, and kept it g-rated. i just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. i don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. death is part of life. most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept. aita?", "my sister and i recently had an argument that got very heated about whether or not i deserve a larger serving size when we have dinner.\n\nwe were both having salmon and she put hers in the oven before i did, when i put mine in i noticed that the pieces were quite small, however she said she was entitled to half of it since it wouldn't be fair that we have different amounts if we are both hungry.\n\nfor reference i am around 6'1 and she is around 5'4.\n\ni tried to explain that we have different dietary requirements because i'm bigger and that the degree to which i would be hungry would be greater than the degree to which she would be hungry if we had the same portion size, though she insists that it's only fair that she shouldn't have to sacrifice her half for me, though i think i'm sacrificing by letting her have half in the first place. she says that i should supplement my

understandably a mess. i don\u2019t blame her, but sometimes i think it\u2019s annoying. we\u2019ve been spending as much time as possible together as a family which i really enjoy, but it\u2019s incredibly difficult to enjoy my last months on this world when my wife becomes inconsolable. \n\ni do my best to comfort, her i really do, but it\u2019s hard to assure someone that everything will be fine after your own death. honestly it makes my time with her more depressing. i don\u2019t want her to have to think about it as much, i want her last months with me to feel like the best months of her life. when i\u2019m gone i want her to think about the great places we\u2019re going, the amazing love we\u2019re making, the fantastic foods i\u2019m cooking for her, only the good things, she can\u2019t do that if every time i get close to her she starts crying. \n\nlast week, we were cuddling in bed and i asked her to be big spoon. i turned around and she got on my back. i could hear her smelling my hair. she then started quietly crying. i asked her what was wrong, she said she was going to miss the way i smelled. i turn i sat up with her so she could cry on my shoulder.  after she stopped i brought up my displeasure. my exact words were, \u201ci know you\u2019re hurting and i want you to feel better and take care of you as much as possible. but right now, i need to to shut up about my death. it\u2019s not doing any of us any good to talk about or think about my death.\u201d\n\nshe was shocked, she told me that she\u2019s never seen me be such an uncaring asshole. i

"just for some background, my family is a bit larger. we are all pretty healthy people, but we are not naturally thin. both of my parents are bigger, i\u2019m a bit bigger, and growing up my sister

healthy\u201d but  from my perspective she is constantly stressing herself out to maintain this appearance with all of the running etc. \n\nmy daughter turned 14 a couple of months ago, and has been expressing distaste about her body for a while. she\u2019s a bit chubby like myself. it makes me sad, but i\u2019m trying to teach her to love herself for who she is. i know that my words haven\u2019t gotten through to her, as she has been going to my sister for advice.\n\nfirst was the at home exercises and running. it is difficult to watch her beat herself up with these exercises. she claims to enjoy them, but i\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t do them if she didn\u2019t want to be skinny like my sister. then she started regularly complaining about the food that i prepare. i\u2019m not a huge vegetable person, and neither is anybody else in our family. i\u2019m not going to waste money on it. it has led to many arguments between us. \n\nthe final straw was when i opened up a package that turned out to be a food scale for my daughter. my sister bought it for her. my daughter told me that since i will continue to make her eat unhealthy food, her aunt told her to weigh it out so she doesn\u2019t eat too much. \n\ni immediately confronted my sister about it. she is trying to push her lifestyle habits onto my daughter. i\u2019m trying to teach her to love herself not spend mental energy fighting biology. she tried to blame me for making my daughter \u201cunhealthy\u201d in the first place, she claims to be trying to help. just because my daughter can\u2019t run a mile and do the difficult exercises she does to maintain her weight, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not healthy.\n\ni hung up with my sister and went to post to facebook about her buying my young daughter a scale and encouraging her to weigh her food. people look up to her, and i think everyone should know that she pushes young women to hate their bodies. my post received a lot of criticism and some people even think i\u2019m an asshole for trying to tarnish my sisters image and for refusing to let my daughter try to lose weight.\n\nfrom my perspective i\u2019m just trying to spread awareness about what she is doing. someone recommended that i post here, aita for telling everyone that my sister got my daughter a food scale, or is she for getting her one in the first place.\n\n\u2014\njust to respond to everyone, we are not obese we are just a bit taller and a bit chubby. maybe a little bit overweight. we may not run and stuff but we do other activities that we enjoy like gardening, swimming,

of effort and budgeting to reach but we have our dream house. \n\nwe closed on the house in february and ya'll already know what happened in march. we were invited by his parents to stay with them for a bit while we figured out how to move our belongings and get things going without the professional help we were counting on.\n\nwhen we bought the house we knew we wanted to do *some* renovations. we held off for a bit because people were getting laid off left and right. then in may, we both found out from our respective companies that we'll be on wfh status for a while (me: until at least october, for him until 2021) but other than that our jobs are super secure. also, we both have friends in management and \"off the record\" talks have confirmed that we have nothing to worry about in terms of losing our jobs. \n\nso we decided that since our finances are secure and we're happy to stay with his parents for a while (and they insisted that we stay) that we're just gonna go all-in and get all the renovations/upgrades that we want done.  we decided on a little over $150k worth of renovations and after that anticipating another $50k so i can decorate it exactly how i want.\n\nthe problem we're having now is that my husband is discussing these renovations with other people - both his friends and our shared friends. i feel very uncomfortable with this. i know a ton of people who were furloughed/laid off and just as many people who had scheduled raises/bonuses cut. as well as several healthcare workers (including my sister and cousins!) who are fighting on the front line but got their hours drastically cut. \n\ni told my husband that right now is not that time to be sharing this. it's insensitive because we look frivolous and tone-deaf in a time where so many people are struggling. he says that's alright because we worked hard and weren't handed any money. that's true and i'm proud of that, but right now is not the damn time! especially because nothing \"needs\" to be done to the house, this is all by choice. but he wants to share with his friends (at least half of whom have been hit economically in some way by this crisis) and brothers because he's used to sharing everything with them.\n\nthis isn't a huge end of the world fight, but it's bugging both of us.", "we've got twins, sara and syed.  they're 14 and entering high school this year.  for clothes shopping, i decided i'd just give them some money and let them buy whatever they want with minimal oversight.  i told them both i'd give them $300 now, and another $300 for winter.  my idea is they're old enough to budget and make these kinds of decisions for themselves.  they can spend the money online, or at the mall, whatever they want.  \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nso they both said they wanted to go to the mall and i went with them.  i wanted to just let them loose, but my 2 14 year olds walking around with $600 didn't sit well with me.  we had a few conversations about the most efficient way to do this.  figure out what you need, and what you want.  find out the stores you want to shop at, get an idea about their prices, then when we get to the mall do a walkthru at all of these stores and find out what kind of deals they have and what items you want.  then go back, try shit on, and buy what you like.  \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nsyed took my advice well.  he went into a few stores, and found the ones that had the best deals that he wanted.  he bought 3 pairs of pants for $100, 5 shirts for $100, then a pair of vans on clearance for $30.  he had money left over so he bought a video game.  \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nsara kinda just casually shopped through the stores and bought what she liked.  all of the prices were reasonable so i didn't say much.  she actually ended up with about 2x the amount of clothes (plus accessories) syed did.  but sara started complaining that it wasn't enough money to get everything she needed.  i told her then she can return some stuff and buy what she needed somewhere else?  she said no, what she already bought is stuff she needs so that wouldn't help.  i said oh well, thems the brakes.  you gotta budget better and prioritize.  she'll get more money in a couple of months.  she was unhappy.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nwhen we got home sara cried to my wife   she complained that its unfair her and syed get the same amount because girls have more needs when it comes to clothes than boys.  she points out that she had to spend $50 just on underwear, while syed paid $0.  i actually demanded they both spend $30 to buy socks and underwear that i paid for personally, separate from the $300.  why does a 14 year old girl need to spend $80 on underwear?  obviously she already has underwear, and i'm giving her more money in a few months.  i would just buy her more underwear if she really needed it anyway.  \n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nboth wife and sara insist that syed can just pretty much wear the same shit every day and no one would care.  but as a girl, she needs at least 2 weeks worth of unique outfits plus matching accessories.  its not about spending the same amount on both kids, its about spending enough to put them on the same social level.  i'm not sure if thats true.", "i am in the process of retiring from the military after a 23+ year career and my spouse and i are looking to move to texas, which our family knows about. the other day i posted

would move closer (family and in-laws live relatively close in either ga, sc, or nc, so easy to visit), but they understand our reasoning in moving to texas with the numerous veteran benefits. on the post a couple of friends were asking what kind of house we are looking at and i replied; 4+ bed, 2+ bath, 2500sqft minimum.\n\nfor some reason this seems to have struck a nerve with one of my brothers who begins questioning why we want such a big house with just my spouse and i, as we don't have kids being a same sex couple. i initially explain that we would have our master bedroom, a guest room, and since my spouse works from home he can set up a room as an office like we have now, and then use another room for his video games and crafts. (currently this hobbies and work are all in one room, but we feel seperating the two would give him a break from his work and play time, so he doesnt feel like he spends all day in that one room.) also, we have floated the idea of adopting now that we won't be moving every couple of years with the military. i thought that would be it,.but no.\n\nmy brother then proceeded to rant about how him and his girlfriend and her toddler live just fine in a micro-home (it's a converted storage shed that resembles a home from the outside), and that all that extra space is going to be higher utility bills, taxes, and just wasted space. at this point i was irritated and replied, \"quit being a jealous dropout, i have bust my ass for 23+ years to get where i am,  maybe if you hadnt dropped out of high school you wouldn't be living in a storage building and judging how i spend my check. \n\nmy spouse and a couple of family members and friends said i went to far and was an ah for that response,

terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.\n\nthese past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.\n\nsuffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not

stuck to are lacrosse and karate. \n\nmy son started getting into the history of the 2 sports about two years ago and has gotten very into japanese culture. he\u2019s very into anime now and a few months ago started taking japanese lessons. our son also loves collecting japanese antiques from a huge antique mall near us. we\u2019re white, we try our best to look up and make sure our son is being respectful when he talks about something or tries something related to his cultural interest. \n\na few days ago, i got a call from a mother of one of his twin\u2019s/my daughter\u2019s (13f) friends (13f) parent. the girl\u2019s older brother (14m) was snooping through her phone to find out who her crush was, when he got a notification from a group text she was in, my daughter and her friends were mocking some of the items my son had bought and making various racist jokes about asian people. the boy was punished for snooping through his sisters phone and the girl was punished for her racist jokes, but it was apparent my daughter played the largest role here.\n\nafter finding out, i told my husband and we were both very angry, our daughter was at a friends house when we found out and when she got home, we had a talk with her and she kept saying it was no big deal and made mean comments about her brother. we then got her brother, told him what happened, he started crying (he\u2019s very emotional) and asked to facetime his friends so he could vent, she didn\u2019t want to apologize for any of the hurtful stuff she said. \n\nas a result of her behavior, we decided to ground her for a month (which is about when school starts), she can\u2019t see her friends or use her phone, we are also giving her allowance to her brother for a month, he can put more money to buying more stuff he likes, which she mocked. we also bought a middle school level book on japanese history and culture that we\u2019re gonna quiz her on when she finishes. when my parents found out,

my older sister and i were poor. our parents put food on the table, a roof over our heads and clothes on our backs, but that's about it. my sister and i couldn't afford college. she got married young and had two kids. her husband is a good guy, but they have struggled with money. my wife and i met when we were both 20, have one kid and one on the way. we also struggle with money, but to a lesser extent. with a new baby coming, we'll be just about breaking even every month.\n\nseventeen years ago, my parents had another baby. for the sake of privacy, i'll call him tom. he's done well in school and has three college offers. even with financial aid, he won't be able to afford to go somewhere even local, as our parents will not be able to support him at all.\n\nwhen tom was born, i was 17 and my older sister was 19. we both wanted to make sure that tom would have the opportunity to go to college that we didn't have, so we saved as much money as we could for one year, put it into the stock market and planned to give it to tom for college when he turned 18. we ended up saving $2000 each ($4,000 total). we each put our halves into separate td ameritrade accounts, and invested it all in a low risk fund. the money in each account is now worth nearly $23,000, so $45,000 total.\n\ntom has been accepted to an amazing college to study engineering, and with financial aid, he'd need to take out about $40,000 in loans. he would never do this because the fear of that debt is too much. my sister and i fully intend on keeping our promise and giving tom the money to make sure he gets a better life than we've had. in many ways, he is our son as well as our brother.\n\nwhen i met my wife i told her that i'd put $2,000 aside for tom when he got older. last week, i told her how much it was worth now. i probably should have updated her as the investment grew, but in my head, this money isn't mine, its tom's.\n\nmy wife thinks that tom should get the money from my sister if she wants to give it to him, but not from me. this is because if we use my half to add to out current savings, we could finally afford to buy our first home. if prices increase even more, she thinks (reasonably) that we will never be able to buy. she thinks my obligation to our own children to provide a stable financial future is more important. she can see my side, but thinks without using this money to buy now, we may be renting precariously forever. i think my sister, who is worse off than we are, is keeping her promise, and this money was set aside for tom before i met my wife. aita?", "my daughter is

shower/bathe together, and because the bathroom shares a wall with my bedroom and the kitchen, no matter where i go in the flat i hear exactly what they're doing. then the shower stops running and my brother leaves, and exactly 10 minutes later, often to the exact second, the girlfriend leaves. she spends the 10 minute interim playing games on her phone.\n\nthe reason for this is that she doesn't want me to see them leave the bathroom together. she is unaware of the sound issue and thinks that i have no idea they even entered the bathroom together, and hopes that 10 minutes will be enough for me to believe that my brother had his shower and left and then she entered and had hers separately.\n\nhowever, this 10 minute pause between them finishing in the bathroom and her leaving the bathroom

bed.\n\nwibta if i said to her \"look, i know what you're doing in there, i don't have a problem with it as you're fully consenting adults, but the time you wait between him leaving and you leaving is

she mentioned that she has never been there.  i told her we should go together sometime and we started planning it.  we ended up deciding on going there for my birthday.  during the planning we realized that my mom, my brother, and i had never been on a trip together, just the 3 of us, so we invited my brother too.  my husband was fully supportive of us taking this trip and would be staying home with our 3-year old son and our dog.  \n\nbefore we left last week my husband gave me the gifts he bought me for my birthday.  he got me some comfy pajamas, a sun hat, and some good wine and cheese to bring with on the trip.  normally, i would be totally ok with that gift as we don't really splurge on bday gifts anymore.  but he had been talking about getting me a smart watch and new luggage for my trip ever since we started planning it.  \n\nhe knows i can be kind of picky about gifts as i have exchanged some of the gifts he's got me in the past for different colors or options.  but this time i told him to just pick something out for me as i want those things for the trip.  he offered instead to go shopping with me so that i could pick out exactly what i want because if i take them on the trip and don't like them, it's not likely i could return or exchange them. i thought that was a good idea, but life got busy and before i knew it, it was the week of our trip and we hadn't had a chance to actually go shopping together.  \n\nso the time comes for us to leave and part of me was expecting my husband to surprise me with a new watch or weekend bag, but he didn't.  i admit i was pretty disappointed that he didn't take the initiative to just get me those things on his own.  i tried not to let it bother me during the trip, but it was always kind of in the back of my mind.\n\nafter we got back, i mentioned to him that i was disappointed that he didn't get me the watch and bag like he said he would.  he told me that he thought we had agreed to do it together but i told him he knew how busy we were and it wouldn't have been much effort for him to just do it on his own.  \n\nhe got offended and told me that i just spent thousands of dollars on a nice, relaxing trip with my family while he stayed home and took care of everything, and i'm complaining about a watch and a bag?  i told him that he knew how much i was looking forward to having those items for my trip and i'm just disappointed that he didn't realize that and take the opportunity to do something special for me.  \n\nhe apologized for \"ruining my trip\" but i know it wasn't sincere and he's just telling me what he thinks i want to hear.  i offered to go shopping with him sometime to pick them out and he told me to just go do it myself.  \n\nnow i feel like crap and i know he's mad at me

also wouldn't tell me what exactly she is doing, all i know is that it is connected to her degree and it is 100% not a sex work or nothing in that industry. the reason why she won't tell me is because

terrible choice and that the whole family dislikes him and that it was her fault everyone has distanced themselves from her. she told me my thoughts and feelings were ugly. i told her that i wanted nothing to do with her or her husband and that i was sick of her choosing him over us. i told her she would never meet her grandchild if he was around.\n\nam i the asshole? she never technically did

through social media, oblivious to the chaos. \nfinally, i reached the end of my fuse and yelled at the parents about being shit parents, and we left shortly after. now i feel guilty about yelling,

sacrifices than any child should have to make. she has unintentionally been put on the back burner ever since her younger sister was born, it is clearly taking a toll on her and i felt really bad. the poor child cannot even have playdates unless i'm there because my wife cannot manage another child alone on top of our two because our daughter with autism needs constant supervision, can be aggressive and is very prone to meltdowns. she cannot even go to friend's houses unless i'm there to help unless the other parent can drive her and bring her back because our daughter with autism is too difficult to handle in cars without another adult there. she has also been subject to aggressive behaviors from her sister and has been always expected to let her sister have the first turn, the biggest piece and the winning ticket so to speak. she is also had her toys frequently destroyed by her sister.\n\ni partly blame myself for this and i'm trying to do better by her, she has been dying for a kitten ever since she could speak but my wife kept saying no because she couldn't handle any more work as our autistic daughter requires so much care. i see the longing look on my daughter's eyes whenever there's a kitten on the television in a magazine etc. i've tried to get easy pets like a betta fish so my wife wouldn't be overwhelmed but she still wants a kitten.\n\nmy wife is a sahm

her face ever since having her new kitten brought tears to my eyes and i'm not a crier. \n\nmy wife is furious with me and has demanded that i return the kitten, our daughter cried so much overhearing this i have usually acquiese to her but this time i put my foot down and said absolutely not i understand she's overwhelmed but our daughter deserves a little bit of joy in her life for once, and as she gets older she will be able to handle the kitten more. our daughter is a person and not just supposed to be a decorative artifact in her sister's story. i understand she's the one who's home and has to help take care of it much of the time, but it will not be a kitten forever and it will grow into a more independent cat. at least our daughter was asking for a kitten rather than a puppy which is a lot more work.\n\ni've seen a lot of posts on here about adult children of disabled siblings going no contact with their parents due to emotional neglect and i am trying to prevent that from

followed her, so i could see what she was posting, which she agreed to.\n\na couple weeks ago i decided to check her profile, as i hadn't seen one of her posts in a while, despite her being on there all the time. it's public, not private, so she changed her settings, and i'm no longer following her. i'm assuming i was softblocked as i can still see her profile. however, the part that concerned me most was her bio. she has her full date of birth, full name, town name, ethnicity, other info about her, and photos of her and her friends in their school uniforms, with the school crest visible.\n\ni told her why this was a problem, but she responded that it wasn't a problem. i told her she has 2 options: take an internet safety course, or delete/deactivate all her profiles. she chose the first option. i paid for a short course (an estimated 4 hours to complete).\n\nit took a couple days, at which point she told me she'd taken the course and passed with flying colours, even showing me the certificate that said she passed. i gave it a day, checked her profile, and it was exactly the same, except i was blocked, and had to go on incognito to check it. i also checked the course website and it said that \"you\" (as in the user) spent 17 minutes on the course.\n\nthat was the last straw, so i told her to delete/deactivate everything, and i put software on the pc, which i've used to block

reinstate it, and apologise for being paranoid and controlling and let her make her own choices about her personal safety. i've said she's 13 with no concept of internet safety, she can have social media back when she understands how any aspect of online safety works. my mother feels this is unreasonable and that i have moved the goalposts as she completed the course like i asked, but there's no way she completed a 4 hour course in less than 20 minutes. mum says she's 13, not a little kid, and i need to trust that she knows what she's doing. i said she has to earn that trust first, and mum

has deteriorated and with little progress, it\u2019s not getting better. \n\nthis is when i decided to lock the fridge. t has been in total despair recently about her weight gain and her inability to control her eating. i thought that if all the food in the household was only given to her with supervision, it would help her not constantly binge eat. \n\nhowever, when my wife came back from her business trip (3 days later), she was absolutely fuming. she said that it was the most careless thing a person could do to someone with an eating disorder and that i have alienated t. she was also upset that i didn\u2019t put anyone else in our family into consideration, especially her. i didn\u2019t see how me locking the fridge could have a big effect, but she said it bought back bad memories

little bit more moody than usual, i haven\u2019t seen any other real negative impacts. \n\ni explained this to my wife, but she refused to even listen to what i had to say. i then called her selfish,

have spent a lot of nights having to comfort her - however, i suggested that she could use this method and try to support t, and help her gain confidence. she was really upset that i called her selfish, and said that i was making her choose between her keeping a good relationship with food and t - she stormed off after calling me an asshole, and is refusing to talk to me. our oldest daughter

probly cause the only monster she knows is cookie monster, but apparently now my niece walks around the house saying \"el chupacabra!\" all day and now my sister &amp; brother in law are mad at me for

vaccinated, i want to take them to disneyland. my brother jack, who's kids are about the same age feels the same. disneyland is expensive, the trip will be about 8k each family total, but my brother and i both have great jobs so its not a struggle for us. my sister jane is always talking about how broke and underpaid she is and complaining about her student loans. i dont know her salary but she's a social worker so i know its not a ton.\n\nwell my brother and i figured she wouldnt be able to afford it, based on a couple weeks ago when we brought up the idea of a vacation at a labor day cookout and she just went on about how she wishes she could afford a family vacation...well since she said she couldnt we just didnt invite her and planned a trip with our wives and our kids. this weekend people were over and my nephew (jack's son) brought up how excited he is for disney. to which jane asked about it and the details came out, (we had just decided in the last week to go there). and then jane got all mad for not getting invited. i told her i didn't invite her because she literally said she couldnt afford a vacation. she then said i was rubbing it in that we make more money than her and that we could've covered part of her trip and then had a real family vacation with everyone.\n\ni just felt like as we're all adults with our own families, were past the age i'd be subsidizing her for anything that s not an emergency...but then yesterday she sent a really passive aggressive text about it basically calling us assholes...\n\n**this hasnt been planned for a long time, we had just started planning it a few days before my nephew spilled the beans. trip is in december. plan was originally not to tell the kids yet but my sister in law got overexcited and shared with her kids**\n\n**people are saying we just \"assumed she couldn't afford it\". she literally told us she cant afford a vacation while we were initially discussing going on a vacation so we planned one based on our budgets. i didnt think that after the vacation was chosen we had to go back and tell her, especially after choosing a pricy destination. that would feel like rubbing salt in the wound.**

all my aunts, 5 of them, are mad at me because apparently skinny people can't be body shamed and that i should have told her first that i don't like those comments instead of straight out calling her out on her  watermelon ass like i did. \n\ni don't think i'm the asshole because it's not like i told her that i'm skinny because my sisters and i have always exercised more so we didn't inherit the

her cousin were born around the same time, my wife really expected them to also be best friends. with sixteen years of hindsight, i can say with certainty that the expectation was misplaced. \n\nnothing happened in particular. my daughter just doesn't like her cousin. my wife keeps pushing the relationship. this includes making my daughter spend time with her cousin during family gatherings, inviting her cousin on trips, forcing my daughter to call her. \n\nwe're pretty sure i'm the favorite parent (a fact that keeps my ego well-inflated), and, therefore, my apathy towards the situation is not well-received by my wife. from my perspective, this isn't important, and i do not possess the ability to make two teenagers become friends. i'm also pretty sure that trying to push this kind of knuckleheaded stuff makes kids not want to speak to you. \n\nthis is where i'm probably an asshole. yesterday, my wife forced my daughter to video call her cousin. my daughter rejected to request, and my wife told her: \"unless you have a valid reason for disliking your cousin, you will do this because we're family\". the call occurred. this morning, we awoke to a powerpoint presentation titled *valid reasons to dislike \\[cousin\\].* using clips from the zoom call, segments included *why is \\[cousin's\\] voice so grating? a music theory approach, a case study: conversations that provide no value*, *rethinking the idea that there are no dumb questions*, ect. with the benefit of a couple of hours of hindsight, it was a very cruel takedown of her cousin's entire personality. \n\nmy wife was furious. my eldest daughter and i lost our shit laughing. my wife is demanding i support her in punishing my daughter for bullying her cousin. i have refused

i announce i am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why i'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think \"yeah i might go too\" ending the party earlier. i prefer to just disappear.

get me a prosthetic leg that allowed me to get back to running and going trips with my friends like we always do every summer.\n\n\nthe guys were planning an rv trip on the weekend, we had already chosen a destination which was spending some time out in nature and getaway from stress.\n\n\nmy girlfriend asked if she could come along, i told her no, this is a guy's trip, told all my buddies' girlfriends wanted to go but they were firm and put their foot down, she laughed at me for this then tried to convince me to let her come cause she was feeling stressed out from being at home 24h, i already made up my mind, i wasn't going to ruin the trip just because she wants to be on a guy's trip, i promised her a trip when i get back, she got upset and didn't like the idea.\n\nlater on,

accommodate any physical changes i had.\n\ni woke up in the morning and i couldn't find my prosthesis, i looked where i put it but it was gone, i asked my girlfriend who was doing heavy cleaning around the place, and she said she didn't see it, i was confused it was near my bed, i asked her to stop being childish and playing games and give back my prosthesis because i knew she took it.\n\nshe's a bad liar couldn't even deny it, she said she wanted to hide it so that i won't go on that trip and leave her alone. i got mad at her for this, i was stunned to find my prosthesis hidden underneath an auto part in the garage, it had been damaged, it was placed in a possession where it had a crack, it was abvious it no longer functions properly, i mean i could still wear it but can't put my whole weight on it cause it would break.\n\ni yelled at her and showed her what she did, she said she didn't mean it, i told her she did mean it because she was being childish and jealous over a trip and now she caused me 7000$ worth damage, i told her she ruined everything, that she owed me a new one and that she needed to pay for a new one.\n\nshe got mad and left, i basically had to use my old crutches it felt absolutely horrible, i called the guys and told them i wasn't coming, it's been a few days, she's mad that i'm still asking her to pay for a new prosthesis and called me an a**** for not apologizing and preferring a \"plastic leg\" over her.\n\ni had to call my parents today to tell them they told me she should at least help pay half the expense of a new prosthesis since she caused damage to it, and then consider my relationship with her.\n\nhave i been an a**** to her ?", "i know that the title reads poorly, but please hear me out.\n\nabout a month ago, i (25m) was approached by my fianc\u00e9e's (23f) best friend, we'll call her sarah. sarah has always been the wild friend of the group. i'm not the biggest fan of having her around because it usually results in her saying or doing things that make other people uncomfortable. sarah sent me the following text: \"hey (op)! the bachelorette part is coming up next month and after talking with the other ladies, we thought it would be funny to have one of the gifts be a customized dildo that you make for her\".\n\nnow, after reading that text multiple times, i had major reservations given what i know about sarah. however, she protested and said that it would be good natured fun for my fianc\u00e9e so i agreed.\n\nsarah came over to my apartment about a week later with a slightly different plan. she wanted to give four, yes four, different color molds of my member to my fianc\u00e9e. she said she spent around $200 on the diy kits and asked that i split it in half. at this point, i had been working up the confidence so i was all in. thankfully, it was a relatively painless process. sarah prepped the molds and i went to another room to do the deed. the molds turned out great and i thought the plan was actually working.\n\nthis past friday, the bachelorette party was nearly called off (they cancelled most of their plans due to what's currently happening) so they spent the evening drinking in my fianc\u00e9e's apartment. i had texted my fianc\u00e9e earlier in the night telling her to have fun and expect a special surprise from me that sarah would give her in private. i could not have been more wrong.\n\napparently, sarah had decided to change her plans and pulled out gift bags with party favors for each of the guests (who included both of my sisters and my fianc\u00e9e's younger sister). sarah had placed the customized molds of my johnson in four random bags out of the 8 girls present. my fianc\u00e9e did not receive one and has to watch my sister holding a skin colored mold of my penis while sarah drunkenly tells everyone that it was, in fact, mine. she tells everyone that it was my idea. it also turns out that no one else was consulted, so it is sarah's word against mine.\n\nit's been nearly 48 hours and my fianc\u00e9e will not speak to me. my own family has now heard the story and both my sisters said that it was a stupid prank. literally the only person who has texted me was my fianc\u00e9e's sister who thought it was funny....\n\nso verdict? i do feel some sense of responsibility for not thinking of this outcome.\n\ntl;dr: i mistakenly trusted my fianc\u00e9e's maid of honor and she distributed molds of my dick to my fianc\u00e9e's friends and sister and accused me of planning the entire thing.\n\nedit 1: since everyone is asking

is the way to go for the future and the country we live in is expensive. as a computer scientist myself, i've always loved my job.\n\nhowever, she does not want to be one. i've been influencing her since she was 10. she was initially excited but doesn't want to anymore. she took 2 tech classes in grades 9 and 10 and she isn't taking one in 11th or 12th grade. she says that she wants to be a psychologist and now wants to have a business major. i don't it's a right fit for her, the former because she doesn't have the social skills needed to become a psychologist (she's autistic). hell, she couldn't handle her brothers well, how is she supposed to deal with adults with psychological issues? the latter as well because it involves dealing with people that can be immature as hell. also she took a business course in grade 10 and she ended up not liking it so why would she take an entire university program.\n\nyesterday, we sat down and were looking at potential programs. she picked a few from bachelor of commerce programs. i tried pushing her to pick the bachelor of computer science programs. at the end, she asked if i would support her no matter what she picks. i laughed at told her not to give me a scare. \"so it's a no then?\" she asked. i told her that she can take her highlighter, highlight the programs she's interested in, and we can discuss. she said that i criticize every program that isn't tech related. i tried convincing her that the tech field is a very rewarding field and she is smart and capable and then she snapped.\n\nshe said that she doesn't care if it's a gold mine and she's capable enough to handle it, she hates the computer tech field and i've been forcing her to do it for a long time. she says it's her future, not mine, and not everyone wants to be a tech scientist. she asked how i feel if my father tried to push me to the law field since it's a rewarding job despite me having no interest in social sciences. then she stormed out\n\nat that

both english and french to our children (my husband is belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in english in a french sentence or vice-versa. this has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school.\n\nmy sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and i will just gently correct him.\n\nanyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. i

talking to my dad outside and i was feeding my daughter in the other room, and i'd left louis with sarah and dave. when i came back downstairs, louis was crying, and i managed to understand that he'd tried to ask sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. i asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that i shouldn't be \"ignoring my son's obvious speech issues.\" for context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. she told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.\n\nthis really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle louis. that night at the dinner table, sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in \"bad\" english (she is english, i just mean that she asked for it in slang. think, \"pass *us* the peas, will you\". i had a bit of an epiphany and i just decided to totally ignore her. she asked again, and i did the same thing. my brother asked why i was ignoring his wife and i said that i'm not able to reply if she can't speak english correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar.\n\neveryone's pretty

but told me while she appreciated the thought she was a little upset that it wasn\u2019t jewelry. i was confused so she explained that she felt anniversary\u2019s should be more about romantic/sentimental gifts versus practical, that she appreciated it greatly but couldn\u2019t lie to me that she wished it had been the necklace she pointed out to me online (it was nothing fancy, a $30 mushroom necklace). i shared my woes with my friend and my friend thought it was hilarious that i was so inept, and that he understood why my gf was upset with her gift. gf\u2019s best friend also got wind of the situation and has been ribbing me with telling my gf to get back to the kitchen jokes etc. my gf and i are fine but i know she was disappointed, and she ended up buying the necklace

cream order was screwed up and he got something different, it was like watching a 5 year old kid. still, we\u2019re trying to deal with this fucking  idiot. then he started looking at the pictures in our fridge, and then he turned to my wife and said\u201d wow i almost didn\u2019t recognize you in this picture, you look so good\u201d. backstory, my wife gained some pounds over the years, maybe 15,20 pounds, it\u2019s not much ,but she hates it, makes her super sad and self conscious. so when this fucker said that, i just lost it and said \u201c alright man, you\u2019re done, get the fuck out\u201d. my wife was paralyzed and so was our friend, and then i continued \u201c i\u2019m sorry but he\u2019s been an asshole since he got here, this is my house, and you dont come in here and talk shit about my wife, so yeah, get the fuck out\u201d. the idiot couldn\u2019t believe what was happening, then my friend started crying, grabbed her purse and they left. he didn\u2019t say a word. my wife also started crying as soon as they left and said that she couldn\u2019t believe what i just did, that i ruined her friendship, to which i replied saying that i was just defending her against that asshole. she said that i overreacted and just because he was an asshole i didnt have to be one also. so then we argued the rest of the night and eventually decide to stop talking about it cause we would never agree on the matter. my wife tried calling our friend and sending messages but so far no reply. am i the asshole here?", "hear me out. i was at my parent's place. i was over to help out my mom out with the garden. my younger sister is staying at home for college. it seems dad was yelling at her about something. he checked her phone  and found that she is a lesbian. my mom was just watching her yell at him and backing him up. my sister was just crying. i am a pretty soft spoken person and i couldn't stop my dad from yelling but when he was done. i told her to pack her stuff and took her to my place.  she is a pretty sensitive person and my parents are pretty assertive and rude sometimes.\n\ni tried to text my husband but he was in a meeting and he rarely checks his phone while he works. he was surprised to find my sister in our home. i talked him about it and his okay with it but he is upset on two counts. the first being that i didn't give him any heads up and he hates being surprised by anything and that he will have to give up his quiet room which he uses to destress after work. he just hates having things jumped on him. he knows she has to stay here for a while and it makes sense. \n\ni feel like an asshole as i should have done things a bit more calmly. i should talked to my husband before getting her out of there. i was pretty emotional during this whole thing. it was one of the worst things i have witnessed. i know much he loves his room and how great it has been to his mental health to have a place to be alone and process things. it has helped our relationship a lot. i fee like i am not prioritizing him here and i took a major decision without consulting him.", "i had to make the hardest decision of my life a week ago and i want some aita

earlier then expected and she ended up giving birth at the hospital. the day it happened she told me that she was in the hospital and needed me however i had just left the house an half hour prior to go see my father who was likely about to die (he did a few hours after i arrived). i decided to see my father one last time and i felt like it was more important than seeing my child's birth because i will raise him and see him everyday for the next 18+ years and i really need to say some things to my father before he dies. my wife and the rest of her family are fucking pissed at me and said that birth is one of the most important parts of our lives and i needed to be there to support my wife and see the child. obviously i didn't want this shit to happen but i felt seeing my father for the last time was important especially since i hadn't seen him in weeks and we weren't on good terms then which we eventually resolved thankfully. if you'd like to provide any advice you're welcome to as i could use some but i'm mainly here for judgment\n\n&amp;#x200b;", "i\u2019m a 19 year old f with six older siblings. my parents spent most of my childhood spending money they didn\u2019t have on my siblings, so by the time i hit my teenage years, i realized i was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when i turn 18. i started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when i was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. \n\n\nby the time i was 16, i was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. when my parents told me they couldn\u2019t pay for college, i\u2019d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. i\u2019ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. \n\n\nthe issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29f) got married. my parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. to make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. they\u2019d effectively dug themselves into a hole they couldn\u2019t get out of. \n\n\ntwo weeks ago, my mom texted me for the first time since the wedding. she didn\u2019t say hi, ask how i was, or make any small talk. she just said \u201cyour dad and i need a favor. when can we call you?\u201d \n\n\ni\u2019d expected this. none of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they\u2019ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank. i figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. i was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. \n\n\ni was not, however, expecting them to demand i give them all the money (close to $40,000) i\u2019d made from the ages of 14-18. \n\n\nthe exact statement my mom had made was \u201cyou made that money under our roof. we were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...we bought you food and clothes for 18 years. that money is only a fraction of what you owe us...\u201d and so on.\n\n\ni said that food, clothes, and shelter were the very minimum, it\u2019s what they signed up for when they chose to become parents, i didn\u2019t ask for any of it, etc. they responded by telling me that if it wasn\u2019t for them, i wouldn\u2019t have the life i have today. i said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. \n\n\nsince that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is \u201crightfully theirs.\u201d my siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it\u2019s my job as their kid to take care of them. i told them they wouldn\u2019t see a cent of my hard-earned money, and have no right to make such a request.\n\n\ni\u2019m torn. i feel awful for refusing to help them out, but on the other hand, this was their fault. i feel i shouldn\u2019t be responsible for fixing their mess. aita?",

and cake pops.  when i first met everyone years ago, it was the first thing i learned.  everyone talked about everything she made.  even when pete mentioned how good my stuff was, everyone would say that kay sells hers and they\u2019re popular so they must be better.  whenever i bring treats, they are often left untouched because \u201cthey are not kay\u2019s\u201d.  yes, i\u2019ve been told that.  they ask me to bring something every get together and never touch it.  \n\nto be clear, kay is mainly a baker whereas i bake and specialize in professionally decorated cakes.  kay says that overly decorated cakes are compensating for their bad taste and pete\u2019s family agrees.\n\nwe had a bbq monday for memorial day and everyone made their treats.  kay decided to bring cake pops. she posted them on her instagram the night before.  so, and i know this immature, i made the exact same ones she did, same flavor and design. \n\nwe got there and everyone asked where my treats were.  i said they\u2019re in car and i\u2019ll get them in a minute.  so i waited for everyone to be outside then i brought mine in and put them next to kay\u2019s.\n\nafter we eat, i notice the family eating my cake pops and not kay\u2019s.  she didn\u2019t notice at first and then asked if they weren\u2019t feeling cake pops.  they said they just ate them and they were the best she ever made and asked what she did different.  mil even said they looked so much better in person than in the picture.\n\nkay was confused and said hers were still on the table.  that\u2019s when i said, \u201coh, i brought those.  glad you enjoyed them.\u201d\n\nher husband said he hadn\u2019t had one yet (lies, he ate two) and everyone else just said \u201cyeah, they were okay.\u201d  kay didn\u2019t say anything the rest of the night.\n\npete thought it was funny (he didn\u2019t know what i did until the reveal) but his brother (kay\u2019s husband) said yesterday that what i did was mean and i\u2019m just mad that kay is a better baker.  but pete said it\u2019s ridiculous the family, including kay, puts down my baking when they won\u2019t even try it all because i\u2019m not kay. aita?", "i (21f) was in a very bad car accident about three years ago. a drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. my car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. i also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). i'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but i'm learning to deal with them. i got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money i purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one i lost. when i have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. i still limp but some days i don't have as pronounced a limp.\n\nearlier today i went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her girlfriend, and our mother. i drove. i had to learn to drive with my left foot but i'm really good at it now. i also bought a new car with my money and had to go through a ton of therapy to get past my ptsd but i'm doing well there now as well. so, i drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg i also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) i have a handicap placard for my car. i have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. today i did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one i took and went down and around. he was still on the other aisle when i pulled in so i didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.\n\nhe parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how i'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. he then ordered me to move. my group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. i'm sick of people thinking that just because i'm young that i don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. i said \"okay\", and went to the car and got in like i was going to drive off. i was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when i sat down i took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. i then asked him if it was okay if i still parked there. he walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said i could have just told him and i made him look stupid.\n\nmy group was embarrassed and said that i made things awkward because there was a crowd. aita?", "i sure feel like ta but i don't think i am so help me out here.\n\ni live in a non english speaking european country and because of history that means land borders between properties are sometimes very weird. well that is the case with my house and the neighbors, all our houses are about the same size yet out of all the land behind our houses my area is huge i own like 90% of all land there reaching all the way to the woods far behind our houses, meanwhile all my neighbors essentially got tiny strip right behind their houses.\n\nnow the part right behind my house is fenced off yet the rest is pretty much open and my wife and daughters like to use it for gardening. \n\nthe field is used by most of the neighborhood boys to play football on as it is the only flat piece of grassland around they always ask for permission to use it before hand and i always allow it on the condition i get no complaints if i tell them to leave and they don't litter. \n\ni also recently had a pool installed to the far back of my property and fenced it off, this is important later.\n\nwell this is where the issue starts, recently a new family moved in and they seem to think it is public land. i kept catching their kids running around through the flowers and vegetable garden and they even moved their grill on the field and held a picnic on my land. i keep telling them off and informing it is my land, but they just ignore me and the kids sometimes wont leave when i tell them to. a month ago the kids even climbed over the fence around the pool  and when i got them out and went to their parents they just said \"oh we figured it was a public pool\", i had hoped that was the end of it yet these people build a fire pit in the 3 days i was away from my house and when i got back i found it with a bunch of empty beer cans around.\n\nthat was the last straw for me and i hired a company owned by a buddy of mine from when i used to do construction work, bought all the supplies, and 7 days later and a lot of money lighter my entire property was walled off and whenever anyone asked i told them why i was doing that and who they could thank for it.\n\nwell now the new family is treated as if they are a pest and all the neighborhood kids are gutted they lost their football field which has resulted in them picking on the new neighbors kids\n\ni honestly feel pretty terrible, but i also feel like i gave them plenty of warnings before taking drastic actions.", "so my wife and i (27f and 29m) recently had a baby. a sweet baby girl, an absolute ball of joy. we started discussing names a few months before she was born, but we kept getting into arguments because we just couldn't come to an agreement. i'm a traditional man, i like traditional names with a rich history and profound meaning. my wife on the other hand wants to name our child something unique, something that literally no one else on earth will think of. some of her suggestions include: hoohee, joejie, yabba, and buza. any one can see that these names are absolutely ridiculous, and she will probably never land a respectable job. by the way we're both caucasian so these aren't cultural names or anything. i suggested some names like amelia, ella, and sophia, but she said that those were \"too common\".\n\nwe put off the topic of names for a while, but naturally after she was born, we starting talking about it again. she insisted on the name buza but i absolutely refused. i told her no one will take her seriously with a name like that and that she was just pursuing the novelty of unique name without thinking about what actually works for her. i saw that she was completely set on the name that she chose and there was no way i could convince her otherwise. so the next morning i went by myself to register our daughter's name because i was worried my wife would go and do it first. i chose a really pretty name for her that wasn't too old fashioned and i thought my wife would be okay with it. but when i got home and told her, she was furious with me. she said i was an ah, but i think she'd be the bigger ah for giving our daughter a name that could ruin her

dog allergy. usually when i meet with my friend we meet in the open and i take two allergy pills. however, because of all the other medication i take these pills make me extremely drowsy to the point

explained the situation and said i would love her to come but she can\u2019t bring her dog. i said that four of our mutual friends had offered to \u201cbe on a roster\u201d and assist her should she need it. alternatively, if she is not comfortable with this she could bring a person of her choosing to the wedding or i\u2019d pay for a professional aid for the day. i think it is important to note that her dog is not for any additional issues like seizures or anything like that.\n\nunfortunately, she was less than happy with my suggestions. she accused me of being ableist and thinking her

would put me first.", "i\u2019m writing this from my friend\u2019s basement since i was kicked out of my house for this one a few days ago. my wife and i are in our mid-40\u2019s and no kids and solid jobs in finance here in the us. my wife is from a foreign country, we met and got married in our mid-20\u2019s. however, most of her family is from her home country in asia including her parents who she flies out to usa once or twice a year and stays for an extended period of time before they go back home. her parents are in their 80\u2019s.\n\n6 months ago my wife\u2019s mother was diagnosed with a type of colon cancer and in her country there is not the advanced type of care required for this. my wife wanted her parents to come live with us permanently and seek treatment in the us and i agreed because it\u2019s obviously the right thing to do for her family. her mother\u2019s prognosis was fairly grim and it was found that the disease was spreading; and we were given the options of either aggressive chemotherapy or the latter which is to make her as comfortable as she can in her final months. my wife and family opted for the chemo which i was onboard with even though they have no insurance and each treatment was a huge hit to our savings. after 4-5 months of treatment and piling medical bills in excess of $400,000, the treatments are still ongoing. i plan on calling the hospital and try to negotiate that down to maybe half the amount since i read on reddit on another thread that this might be possible, but as it stands currently if i paid all of this it would wipe out all of our savings, plus about half of my 401k after withdrawal penalties are calculated. \n\ni\u2019ve been supportive and willing to take on the financial burden although i\u2019ve thought to myself that it is time to give up. i\u2019ve never said this to my wife or her family and have been outwardly supportive, but inside i\u2019ve been struggling and worried about the future.\n\na few days ago i was at a bar with my friend and discussing my true feelings about the entire situation. the bar was a little loud so i did have to speak up a little bit in order to hold the conversation. i told my friend that i\u2019ve been feeling inundated with these bills ever since the the midpoint of the treatments, and again, although i have put on a smile and want the best for my wife\u2019s family, internally i wanted the financial bleeding to stop and just wanted my mother in law to die comfortably in hospice care. unfortunately, my wife\u2019s best friend was sitting behind us at the bar unbeknownst to me and heard all of this. she called my wife right away.\n\nmy wife and i had a huge argument when i got home and i guess my argument the entire time was that my actions of supporting the medical treatments should have been enough and, quoting a show i recently watched, that \u201cthoughts are not treason\u201d. none of this went over well and hence why i\u2019m out of

specifically want a son. i asked my wife \"ok, what if we have another girl?\" she answered \"then we should try one last time. if we have another girl so be it; we are a family of daughters.\"  i just think her attitude is wrong and only want to have another kid with her if she doesn't care about the gender.  but maybe i'm being unfair due to personal bias. aita?", "as my title suggests, my mom is a huge harry potter nut. she and my dad actually met in a harry potter \u201circ\u201d (like disord but for old people) in the early 00s got married had kids and from day one decided to embarrass us for life by naming us after some harry potter and star wars characters.\n\nit\u2019s honestly been hell. i have a stupid name and since we were little my parents have forced stuff like harry potter, star wars, marvel movies, etc etc down our throats. everything is about dragons and magic and blah blah blah. i\u2019m so sick of it. every birthday every holiday everything is just organized around \u201cfandom.\u201d\n\nso just like every christmas the days leading up to christmas we have to sit down every night and watch harry potter movies. it\u2019s. so. fucking. boring!!!! i can usually get away with knitting or drawing on my ipad during this but this year my mom was like \u201clet\u2019s just have a technology and distraction free night every night\u201d\n\ni arranged to go over to my friend missy\u2019s house instead for like two nights. missy\u2019s family is normal and likes things a normal amount. my mom got really mad and started talking about how it\u2019s a family tradition and how i\u2019m basically rejecting her and went on her whole thing about how \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t exist if it wasn\u2019t for harry potter.\u201d\n\ni finally had it and just yelled \u201cnobody cares that you were a big name in the harry potter fan club!!! i don\u2019t like harry potter! i don\u2019t like star wars! i hate marvel movies they\u2019re all so boring please just let me have my own interests!\u201d\n\ni couldn\u2019t help it i started crying because i was just so frustrated because everything always has to be about harry potter this star wars that and now that we\u2019re all older they started doing game of thrones. everything is centered around some kind of movie or tv show or book series. \n\njust onces i want my family to band around something that doesn\u2019t have to do with media or these nerdy things. we live in utah where we have like 5 national parks and even though i ask every year for my birthday i\u2019ve never even been to arches!!!! \n\nwell my sister called me saying that mom was angry and to just come home and to stop with the theatrics. i told her that i\u2019m sick of having all this old \u201cnerd\u201d stuff crammed down my throat and just once i want to have a normal time watching normal christmas movies and not having to pause for \u201clightsabre battles\u201d.\u201d\n\naita?!??!\n\n**hey guys** i know you think you're \"cool\" and \"in on the joke\" wink wink when you dm me and ask me for my name, but i'm a teenage girl and that's not really how it's coming across. please stop dming me i don't care.\n\n**for

wedding rolls around she\u2019ll be 6 months sober. \n\nbut because of this, my  fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t want any alcohol at the wedding. he thinks it would be too much temptation too soon. i think that\u2019s bullshit, he and his family have always enabled her to keep her happy and i feel like this is another attempt at that. after they\u2019ve spent upwards of 500,000 dollars on bailing her out of prison and new cars, i\u2019m putting my foot down. \n\nthis is my day and i feel like i should be allowed to drink a glass of fucking champagne at my own wedding. my fianc\u00e9 on the other hand thinks that if she\u2019s going to be there, we should be accommodating to her. because of this, our wedding planning has come to a halt and i feel like he\u2019s choosing her over me. so am i the asshole for refusing to have a dry wedding  to appease my fianc\u00e9s alcoholic sister?", "**", "my husband and brother used to be as close as brothers. they had a fight a few months ago and neither one of them will tell me what it was about. i\u2019m sick of it because it feels like they\u2019ve dragged me into the middle of this as they refuse to be around each other but neither one of them is willing to tell me what\u2019s really going on.\n\ni also barely see my brother now and i miss him so i invited him and his wife for dinner like we used to do. my brother only agreed because i told him my husband wouldn\u2019t be home and i told my husband we were having guests but never specified who.\n\ndinner was tense and at first my husband tried to kick my brother out but i wouldn\u2019t let him. after they left my husband and i had a huge fight and now he\u2019s barely speaking to me. my brother isn\u2019t angry at me but told me if my husband says anything to me i

and sam (16m). our mom isn't in the picture, and to be honest i don't blame her. our dad (60sm) is an absolutely awful person, controlling and bigoted to a point. about four years ago he was paralyzed in an accident and is incapable of doing anything for himself. sam has low-functioning autism, and he displays such an indifference to everything and everybody (not malicious, just indifference) that it makes me wonder if he has sociopathy or something.\n\ni retuned home to visit an aunt and visited my family as well. ron was acting angry towards me for some reason, being short and cold and barely even giving me the time of day, and it really ticked me off. i asked what his problem was and he made a snide remark about how if i was stuck taking care of our father all day that i wouldn't be so cheerful either.\n\ni got angry and told him to stop being a martyr and that this is his choice, and that if he really cared then he would put our father and sam into a care home, which made ron mad and he snapped and called me a selfish bitch (i hate that word, i feel like it's demeaning towards women and ron knows that it deeply annoys me) before he stormed off like a child.\n\ni don't regret the general idea of what i was trying to say, but i could understand that how i said that could rub ron wrong. so aita for what i said?", "i recently posted this on r/tifu and they made me wonder if i'm ta\n\nmy ex's wedding was in february. and like you could guess, i wasn't personally invited nor was i told anything about it from him even though we spoke daily. well i found out about it from his grandmother (we're close) and she suggested i 'gate crash' and that she would cover for me (think she doesn't like the bride). i was interested in going because i wanted to find some closure since we had broken up rather quickly a few months before and i still wasn't over him. so i said yes. \n\nthe day came and his grandmother 'snuck' me in and we watched the ceremony. it was beautiful. i shed a few tears but it really solidified things. i was ready to leave afterwards but his grandmother pushed me to go to the reception as well and sit next to her at the family table. pretty awkward but i went. i was still mingling with the family, standing up, when the bride and groom came. they came and greeted and she congratulated me on the pregnancy. i thanked her and said something about how i couldn't wait to co parent with the two of them. turns out that she didn't know that i was pregnant (5 months at the time) with his child the whole time. she lost her shit and ran out. he tried to run after her but then her dad came and started a scene. lucky for me, my ex's brother came and helped get me out of there as soon as possible. \n\nmy ex still asks for updates but i recently heard from his grandmother they broke up and got an annulment. the 'bride' weirdly still follows me and comments/likes my pictures so i think she's fine with me but still, aita?", "i have two sons from a

christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents early. so we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them. it was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when i told them they could open it on christmas eve. they tore into it like a couple savages. i'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get at the goods. \n\nas the final paper was ripped off the present, the oldest was going like \"it's a..it's a\" and the final paper came off, \"brick\". i thought it was hilarious. the looks on their faces was priceless. unfortunatly they were somewhat upset, tears were shed etc. so we let them open one more present to calm them down.\n\nam i the asshole for wrapping a brick as a present?", "i had a party at my house last night. i have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. my step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.\n\nover the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i\u2019d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. \n\nwell a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i\u2019d be happy to give him his quarters back if he\u2019d asked but i\u2019m not a casino and while i\u2019m not destitute, i can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. \n\nso was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?", "i can't believe i'm actually

(f10).\n\nkevin and cole got married 6 years ago and adopted kelly two years later when she was 6.\n\nso a few nights ago, at around 9 pm, i get a call from kevin, who's majorly freaking out, because kelly got her first period. turns out he and cole didn't prepare for this happening at all, so not only do they not have any pads ready, *they also have never talked to kelly about this*, meaning they now have a hysteric 10 year old in their bathroom freaking the fuck out because she's bleeding. so i do what every aunt would do, grab a pack of pads and make my way over to their place.\n\ni get to their apartment, shoo the guys out of the bathroom and have the period talk with kelly. she calms down somewhat, explain how to change the pad to her and then tug her back into bed, since it was past 10 by that point. afterwards i sat down for a cup of coffee with kevin and cole. this is were the conflict starts.\n\nthey thanked me for coming over so fast, i said it's no big deal. then i ask why they weren't prepared for this to happen. kevin explains that they thought they'd have more time, to which i say that was stupid since the first period can happen as early as nine years old. kevin got defensive and said that he googled (are you serious man?) and the average age to get it was 12, so they expected it to be around that age. i felt like facepalming. at this point kevin and i get more heated in our argument until cole tells us to either stop or have the argument elsewhere because they have a sleeping kid here. we agree that we should calm down and discuss this later.\n\ntwo days later, i meet up with cole and kevin again, kelly obviously in school. i once again said that not preparing was stupid, kevin says they had good reason to believe it would be later and that i'm too harsh on them. i tell them that they are supposed to be this girl's parents and that situations like these aren't optimal. cole says i have a point, but kevin is still defensive. he says that they're trying their best, but their still just people and i get that, but this is basic daughter stuff. we argue again for a bit, but eventually just apologize to each other and promise to try and do better next time. at this point, we're not mad at each other anymore, but we still both believe to be in the right.\n\nwhich is why i'm here. was i wrong here? i feel like i wasn't.\n\n&amp;#x200b;", "okay so this is a bit hard to explain, but lets start off from when we met.\n\nokay so i knew this girl (lets name her jessica) since 5th grade and we're both in our senior year at high school. even since we were in middle school, she's always been a nasty, rude, disrespectful and unfriendly person. she always treats people poorly and manipulates her friends. now physically speaking, she isn't a very attractive person. she's obese and not very cute. which is fine, but she always treated her self like a top tier model, what i mean by that is how she's always criticizing how others look and making fun of literally ever boy thats been in our classes. \n\nfor example a boy can walk past her to sharpen his pencil, and she would talk about how ugly he was and how she would never date him and what not. everyone that's not part of her direct circle hated her snobby personality but nobody every checked her on it, so she carried that same childish personality into high school.\n\nanway so a few days ago, we were in english class and our teacher began assigning us partners to work with for this movie project worksheet we had to work on. and you guessed it, my partner was non other than jessica. so i sit a few chairs behind jessica and her circle and right away i heard her moaning like she was being tortured and even heard her talking about how ugly i was and what not. i'm not a handsome person but i'm far from being ugly. anyway the teacher told us to get with our partners and he walked out of the room to get some materiel and what not. as i was walking to her, she starts going \"eww i would never date him. like i'd rather die than date\", mind you she started the whole discussion about if you'd date me and it got me pretty pissed. so i responded and said \"calm down not like i would wanna date your fatass\". she instantly started crying and saying how i was dick for making fun of her insecurities and what not. her little posse of friends jumped in and told me to fuck off and what not. the teacher walked and after a while, he said i should apologize or he'll get the administration involved, i'm in a running for some scholarships, so i didn't want to risk that so i apologized. we got it settled, but pretty much every girl in the school hates me, while the boys all support my actions and told me that it needed to be said.", "my wife and i (both 37, female) have known each other since high school. we grew up in a very conservative part of the us so we were both extremely repressed and didn\u2019t get together until well into our adulthood. we both left our hometown as soon as we were able to (me at 18 when i headed to college, she after college) and neither of us have really visited since. from what we know though\u2014thanks to the power of the internet and social media\u2014the area we grew up in is still incredibly conservative.\n\nmy wife recently got a facebook message from one of our old classmates about a 20th high school reunion that is being organized in our hometown this summer. looking at the event page it seems a lot of people from high school are going. all of our social media profiles are private so they likely have no idea we\u2019re now together.\n\nmy wife immediately jumped to accept the invitation, and assumed i would be ecstatic as well to \u201csurprise everyone about our marriage\u201d. i told her i didn\u2019t really wanna go because: 1) i actually had a pretty shitty time in high school and so i\u2019m not particularly inclined to see old classmates i haven\u2019t talked to in 20 years; 2) she may not even get the reaction she thinks she\u2019ll get; 3) we live far away now and it would be an unplanned travel expense. not that we\u2019re extremely poor, but i\u2019d rather we spend our money on an actual vacation instead of bumming around in our hometown for a week with the kids.\n\ni told her all this, and also said that if *she* wishes to go on her own, she is more than welcome to. but she insisted that it wouldn\u2019t be the same unless we\u2019re both there. one thing that may be relevant here is that my wife hung out with the popular crowd in high school, and so she evidently sees going to a high school reunion arm-in-arm with a woman as some revenge fantasy (like, \u201coh, the prom queen is now a lesbian\u201d or whatever). she\u2019s not normally this high school obsessed but she has mentioned several times she wants to surprise our former classmates with our relationship and financial success. i said the purposeful showiness of this seemed a bit immature and we should just focus on the good life we have now.\n\ngrowing up gay in the 90s in a conservative town was obviously... not great, to put it mildly, and i understand that we each have our own way of coping with the homophobia we experienced. this just seems like a bit of a step back in my opinion. but at the same time, going to the reunion clearly means a lot to my wife, whereas i\u2019m more apathetic.

taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but i shut that down even though my husband thought it was just \"harmless teasing\".\n\n\nmy husband's sister's wedding was last week. the family wanted megan yo go but she didn't want to. i spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. she agreed under the condition that i let her wear a wig

why.\n\n\n\nwe went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. we were all sitting and we started talking about meghan look, suddenly ben reached out and pulled her wig and

husband sitting next to his mom and laughing. i lost it on ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got megan and got into the car and went home. ben and my husband didn't have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but i didn't respond. he came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and ben with no rude home. i argued with him about how ben embarrassed megan and humiliated her publicly which must've ruined what's left of her self esteem. he said that it was just \"kids teasing each other\" and that i overreacted and ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. i said i was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and i was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective

her leg and needed some help around the house. so i went to hers and stayed for the day and we smoked weed together and i fell asleep at hers. \n\nsunday morning i went home and my roommate was furious i'd been gone for two days after i said that i'd be home after work friday. and that i hadn't checked my messages. and that she wanted me to be more considerate and if my plans change tell her in advance if i won't be home for a night.\n\ni got pretty frustrated with her and said that were adults, and that i don't need to check in and out with her. \n\nshe said that she wanted to have a female roommate where we look out for each other and so she's not home alone at night and that she and her roommate have someone looking out for each other. and that she does it for me and that it's inconsiderate of me to not return the favor.\n\ni said maybe she could ask a friend to check in with her daily if that's something she needs, but i don't think i'd remember well.\n\nshe got mad at me

(luckily he is healthy and no health problem)\n\nmy parents, aunt and uncle, and cousins came to see me and discovered that the man i'm hugging is my cousin who is gay and has cancer. i hugged him that time because he announced that he is now cancer-free and in a happy relationship, which made me happy because he is one of my close cousins.\n\nthe dna test results have arrived, and it show that my husband is the father. but when my father discovered the reason for my premature birth, he began to yell at them. he was so upset that he demanded that i divorce him and cut ties with them. i didn't let my husband's grandparents  see my baby after i was discharged.\n\ni don't want to divorce my husband because the only mistake he made was saying hurtful things without first hearing my side of the story. i've been quiet and preoccupied with caring for my son for the past 6 months. my brother-in-law recently divorced his wife.\n\nhis family is still attempting to contact me and apologize, but i'm not giving in. i'd already suffered enough trying to please them and follow all their traditions and stuff.\n\nthey always write me letters telling me that i'm making them suffer by not allowing their grandchild to meet them and that i'm denying my son the luxurious life he deserves.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nmy husband is on my side and tells me to ignore them, and that we have agreed not to spoil our son with material things, but rather with the love and care that every child needs.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nso aita?", "i (17m) was horrendously bullied by this guy, we can call jake (17m). jake was quite popular and sociable but for some reason kept targeting me, calling me names, slurs, etc. i hated him so much, i'd hate going to school and him being in class. i dreaded it.\n\nwell we found out that jake unexpectedly passed away in his sleep. when i saw this on facebook, i saw lots of rip posts from classmates, but my first reaction was relief. i felt a weight lift off my shoulders.\n\nwhen i came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50f) said we need to take a moment silence for him. after the silence was done, i just said out loud ''i don't care that jake died. he was a bully''. people looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, i could hear some people muttering swear words.\n\nbut then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated jake too. honestly i'm fucking glad he's dead. i feel so much better about my life now. some classmates called me ah, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name under the sun, ah was one of them. i just said to her ''you need to calm down and relax'' and walked away. \n\ni honestly feel good and so do some other classmates. aita?\n\n**", "my sister (28) and her husband came home to with my parents and i (21) for the holiday. \nher kids are 8 and 6. \n\na couple of nights before thanksgiving, my sister went to a concert with her husband, and left the kids with my parents. my parents decided they wanted to go to a dinner party, and they just left in the evening and left the kids there with me. \n\ni was not asked to watch the kids, i hate kids.  they just told me they were going out and left them in the living room. \nmy sisters kids are at an age where they\u2019re loud and hyperactive together. you can\u2019t just put a movie on for a time and leave them. \ni\u2019m in my last year of school, and i actually didn\u2019t go hang out with some friends so that i could study. \nso when i noticed this, i just left them alone. \n\ni went to my room to study and locked the door. \n\ni heard a lot of banging, screaming and general ruckus, i checked on them to be sure they weren\u2019t injuring themselves, but i let them do as they please. i wasn\u2019t asked to watch them.\n\nthey ended up causing quite a bit of damage, they broke the tv (i think by throwing stuff at it). they got into my moms oil paints and smeared them *everywhere*. oil paint was on the curtains, walls, sofa, rugs, ceiling *everywhere*. they had dog food thrown everywhere?? (luckily the dog himself was with me) water and juice spilled everywhere in the kitchen. it was a wreck. honestly, i laughed. \n\nhowever, get this, my mom expects *me* to pay for the damages! she said i was an asshole for not just studying down stairs and watching the kids. i was not asked to watch them. i told her she should ask my sister for the money. they are her kids. \nmy whole family

showing them this thread. \n\nbut on the off chance, aita?", "\n\ni'll preface this by saying that i (m35) am a widower with 2 kids (9, 11). i recently got back to work and since i work nightshifts, i had to get the kids a babysitter (they're at school during the day and my sister stays with them) i was able to find a babysitter with the help of a co worker (actually they're related) and things have been going pretty well except for few days ago.\n\n\nthe babysitter called me while i was at work to tell me that my 9 year old daughter broke her glasses, i got home, heard both sides of the story and came to a conclusion that it was in fact an accident. but the babysitter said my daughter broke them intentionally after she refused to let her outside late in the evening. i asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, i figured she lied to set her sister up. my 9 year old daughter cried and said she didn't mean it and it was an accident. i apologized to the babysitter for the misunderstanding but she insisted there was no misunderstanding and then asked me to pay her for a pair of new glasses. i was taken aback by her request and told her i thought we talked this out and rolled it out as an accident but she insisted it wasn't an accident. i apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of wether it was an accident or not. the babysitter argued with me then started crying swearing that my daughter broke them to get back at her. my 11 year old daughter sided with her but my 9 year old said she is only siding with the babysitter for her own benefits. the girls started fighting and i ended up telling the babysitter to leave. she got my co worker involved and she said i should take responsibility and pay the babysitter for new glasses since she can not afford them being a broke college student and in need for glasses. i apologized but refused to pay, my co worker got upset and shamed me for condoning my younger daughter's actions and treating the babysitter poorly when she's the victim in this situation.\n\n\nit's been days and the babysitter is still wanting me to pay for new glasses but i feel like she's trying to use the fact that i'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.", "\nme f31 and my mil don't have a close relstionship. she's civil towards me but can be a bit passive aggressive at times and we tend to disagree often times.\n\n\nwe live in a different state. fil passed away suddenly and mil told me and my husband to come attend the funeral. she booked our tickets to fly to her state. but the issue started when my husband told me that we couldn't sit together in the plane because his mom had booked him a first class ticket while i got ecconomy. i was flabbergasted by this. i tried asking him why but he urged me to \"suck it up, and we'll talk about it later\". in that moment, that particular moment i felt so much humiliation and contempt. i felt like she was treating me as less then even in her hard times. i decided to not go and just go back home. my husband was shocked by my decision to go home and tried to convince me to just go but i declined.\n\n\nhe went alone and i ended up missing the funeral. he was livid just calling m3 and texting nasty things calling me petty and spoiled. he said that i should be grateful his mom paid for my ticket to begin with then said that she doesn't owe me a goddamn thing. i argued about how she could've just booked us both in economy if money was an issue but he called me pathetic for thinking about it when his dad just died. he said it was cruel what i did and that his mom and family will never forget that i missed the funeral over ridiculous reasons.\n\n\naita for going home over this? \n\neta. one of the reasons i didn't settle for the ecconomy ticket was because i wanted to sit next to my husband and support him. he sobbed the whole ride to the airport and i didn't want to leave his side. i was shocked when he told me we couldn't sit together, and how he said it like he had no issue with it.", "my friends and i can only get together once a month. between different work schedules, some having kids, other commitments, it's hard to schedule. but we

but they made an exception for 2 kids, a 13 year old who will be turning 14 a couple months after the trip and is pretty responsible and can take care of herself, and what was supposed to be another 13 year old about to turn 14. the second kid was really 8 and nobody found out until her mom dropped her off at church. by the time anyone realized she wasn't someone's sibling her mom was already gone. the priest was also there but he didn't really do anything.\n\nthey tried calling the kid's mom, who said she couldn't pick the kid up because she was on her way to the airport to go on vacation

got a new number. they ended up letting her go because there wasn't anyone to pick her up.\n\nbasically, the way the trip worked was one of the 18-22 year olds would drive 2-3 14-17 year olds and we'd share a room at the hotel. i ended up sharing a car and room with both the 8 and 13 year olds and emma (22). emma's the oldest of 10 so she knows how to take care of kids and took care of the 8 year old the entire time but everything had to be child friendly all the time except after she'd go to bed the 13 year old would babysit so we could go out (we had a midnight curfew and the kid was in bed by 8).\n\ni was talking to my friend and i said there's a little kid in the room and she's ruining the trip. well, the kid heard me and wouldn't stop crying. emma was pissed and said it's ok to feel

less and less sleep and kept acting aggressive, blaming lack of sleep from the cats, and that if i didn\u2019t get rid of them, she\u2019d leave me. i legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until i noticed something.\n\none morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. she listed a bunch of times. i thought it was weird, because i had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she \u201cgot up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.\u201d i was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and i know none of that happened. things weren\u2019t adding up, so i decided to run a test.\n\ni waited until she said she was going to bed, then i let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. i just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but i definately did not fall asleep. i made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through discord just to be sure. i marked down every noise my cats made. one cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am. other than that, nothing happened.\n\nsure enough, my wife slept from 11pm until 9am, and that morning she claimed she had woken up \u201cat least 7 times\u201d to open doors and from cat noises and cats jumping on her. at this point i was pissed because she was clearly lying to me. i was exhausted and fed up with the lies, so i just bluntly called her out on it.\n\ni told her, \u201cthat\u2019s funny. i stayed up all night to monitor the cats, and they weren\u2019t even in the room at all last night. i have timestamps and everything. so you\u2019ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? why?\u201d she just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. she came back hours later

all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if i was an investigator was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and makes me an obsessive asshole.\n\ni did it

all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. \n\ni'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just

ignore her and keep making my way through the airport, after a minute of this, i lost my temper.  \n\n\nso i eventually snapped and said, \u201clook, either your friends are the most boring people in

with their relationship, keeping in mind they have a child together that they are both involved with. however, i feel as though he does many things that cross lines and boundaries. for instance, he stays up to all hours of the night (4 or 5am) snapchatting and texting her. meanwhile he is possessive of his phone, not letting it out of arms reach and changing his password and turning away while using it. early into our relationship, 3 or 4 months, i had his phone and he admitted to me he had a folder full of her nudes still. i told him he needed to get rid of them, as it is insensitive to me to have them and quite frankly creepy and seemingly a breach of her boundaries. he refused for about a week even going so far as to ask me if he could keep them elsewhere, such as on a flashdrive. he eventually complied and deleted them. now, she works late hours, usually not coming home until four in the morning and won't let him watch their son anywhere but at her home. he tends to fall asleep while waiting for her and doesn't come home until late morning or sometimes even the early afternoon. i offer to stay up and pick him up so he doesn't have to sleep on her couch five nights a week,

is meaning only the ones where i'm trying to express to him why i'm uncomfortable with how he sleeps there so often. this made me really angry and upset, i felt betrayed. i keep trying to tell him that he is crossing all kinds of boundaries and i am not okay with it. i tell him he needs to stop texting her every night until dawn, especially when he's at her house alone at those times most

her first semester and i'm the one paying the bill. i have been saving for over 10 years to do this and i am happy to do it, as long as i feel she is actually setting herself up for success. during high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. she took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. i supported her through all this because i thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.\n\nthis last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. my daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. i was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. she is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. now i know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but i was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. when i tried to get why she was switching all i got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in la. apparently she has been talking

blown off like that. i thought over it all day and so last night i sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. i am the one paying for her education and i won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. i told her if she doesn't want to do cs that's fine. but she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys and can get her a career. and if in the end she decides that she's an \"adult\" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. she can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.\n\nthis did not sit well with her.

office-style cubicle dividers or a curtain to divide the room in two if she wants privacy but then we both realized that this would be a bad idea since they both share a bunk bed since the room is way too small to realistically fit 2 beds. so, in the end i told her that she can either stay in the room with her brother or she can be the one who moves to the living room since it wouldn't be fair to

next few years i started college and got another job to pay for it. for most of their early childhood, i worked two or three jobs and took classes at a community college. some bad events took place at my friend's house and i was forced to move into an apartment. good news? a classmate with a boy my girls' age was looking for a place, so we became roommates and kinda co-parents. worked great, we lived together until i was almost out of uni.\n\nstill working two jobs, i usually had night and early morning shifts and she had day shifts. someone was always with the kids, and when she started working more we got a babysitter. at this point we were still very poor-we wore bras and underwear with holes in them because we didn't have money for new ones. she got engaged, moved in with the guy, and i was forced to find a cheaper apartment i could make on my own. i graduated, got work as a bookkeeper in a legal office, and started earning enough to confidently stay afloat and afford a reliable babysitter. we stayed in the apartment until my kids had moved out and i saved enough to move to a house in a small town (years later).\n\nnow, my girls are posting mean spirited comments on fb and complementing each other. one will post something about 'i didn't know how poor i was until i realized how big a yard can be' and the other one will say 'i always knew, other kids with competent mothers had huge backyards and we had an apartment'. complaining about yards, being 'raised by babysitters', always moving...i got sick of it. i replied on one of their posts saying they always had a safe home with food and at least one adult around to protect them which is more than other children and they shouldn't be whining like this when they were competently cared for. my daughter deleted it, and some friends have pointed out that growing up poor still isn't easy and they were likely bullied and felt some uncertainty for the future. i've been told a good mother would

three children of his own to care for. after some time, he called me and said that he was going to transfer legal guardianship of the children to me per my best friend\u2019s wishes.\n\ni told him i wasn\u2019t sure if i should or could be a parent to them. he said i should give it a try for a little while and see if it\u2019s fine. he said my husband and i could probably provide a better home for them than he could at the moment. i was already very close to the children at that point so i agreed. \n\nmy husband was not as close to them and was reluctant at first, he said he wasn\u2019t sure if he could deal with the household size doubling overnight. eventually he agreed to try it out.\n\nthe issue is that in the months since we\u2019ve taken care of the kids, i have developed a strong bond with them but my husband has not. i never thought in my entire life that i would want children, and i still am not completely sure if i\u2019d ever want biological children of my own, but i know that i want to keep being a parent to these kids specifically and that i\u2019d be heartbroken if they left. \n\nmy husband has more or less tried his best to deal with them but it\u2019s just not working for him. he sees children as a chore and hasn\u2019t developed a strong emotional connection with them like i have. when my best friend\u2019s brother asked if he should start the paperwork to make me the official guardian, i had to give him a rain check. \n\ni want the children. my husband does not. he said he\u2019s willing to take care of them on weekends or something but not be their permanent guardian. he said keeping the children would violate a pretty big part of our marriage, considering he has never wanted children and has even got a vasectomy to prevent them.

the end of senior year, dan came to me and said he wanted to marry fran. at the time, dan had multiple college options which he was going to decline to stay in our town and marry fran. i obviously didn't support this, i wanted my son to go to college and knew he wanted that too as he'd always been ambitious. i told my son that he had his whole life ahead of him and he could get married later, but didn't need to rush it. i told him that if he went to college and waited, even just a year or two, i'd pay for his tuition. at the time i didn't know how serious their relationship was as they'd been together for a little over a year, and was scared it wouldn't work out and he'd waste this opportunity. my son happily accepted this offer and agreed with me that it would be best to wait.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthis year my son graduated college but maintained a long distance relationship with fran, and they announced their engagement a couple months ago. we were all ecstatic about it. sometime between then and now, my son told fran that i was the reason he waited until now to propose. i wasn't aware until christmas when during dinner, fran said she wanted to say something. she began saying i paid my son to not married her and actively tried to ruin their relationship. she then said she was blessed that 'evil hadn't won' and couldn't wait to have a long and happy marriage. everyone was silent and didn't really know what to say. my son approached me later to apologise and said she had twisted his words but it's been constantly weighing on my mind as friends and family present all have different opinions.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**edit**\n\nif my son had married fran out of high school, he wouldn't of gone to college. my son chose to go to a school so far away, there were closer options but he liked the school he chose. i will be showing dan this thread and update if he responds. fran currently works at her mothers bakery. she wants to be a sahm once they get married and was waiting for dan to come back home.\n\n**update**\n\ndan and fran have talked and cleared the air around this situation. fran feels awful about what she said and realised she should've come and talked to me privately. this situation however has brought up other issues between the two and their future, as dan expressed the fran he would like to go to law school. fran wants them to start their life together and thinks it's unfair for dan to make them wait for 4+ years. dan is currently home and we will be dealing with this together. thank you for all the advice, dan has read

acting snobby and i\u2019ve been ignoring it thinking it\u2019d go away. she \u201cdiscussed\u201d more like lectured me on my parenting styles and how \u201cno offense\u201d but it\u2019s really dangerous to let 16 year old go out past 9 pm and have a boyfriend and give him so much freedom while he\u2019s still a kid. i tried my best to ignore it. \n\n\nbut yesterday my son was going to a sleepover, i was in kitchen and so was my sister. he came in to say bye, kinda jumped on me and hugged me, told me \u201clove you, bye\u201d and left. i think that\u2019s pretty fucking normal, but my sister started looking at me weirdly and asked if he always does that, i asked her what he was asking and she straight up told me that it seemed creepy and perverted to have physical contact with my son. i had it up to my neck at that point and i just snapped. i told her that just because her daughter has shitty relationship with her and refuses to talk to her doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not normal to have close relationship with their child and she\u2019s actually sick and delusional for even thinking about something like. she got offended of course and went upstairs to her room. we briefly argued after few hours and she basically said that \u201cshe had good intentions and didn\u2019t mean anything to offend me so much and i should apologize for insulting her and sticking my nose into her and her daughter\u2019s relationship\u201d. we haven\u2019t talked after that and i haven\u2019t apologized to her. so i\u2019d like to hear unbiased opinion on this.", "my dad passed

silly as it sounds, and this post isn\u2019t going to make any sense of it. basically, for as long as i\u2019ve dressed myself, i\u2019ve always put on two pairs of underwear. i don\u2019t know why it started, but i\u2019ve been doing it for a while. i\u2019ve tried to break the habit, but every time i try, i feel physically uncomfortable and just don\u2019t bother.\n\nnow, i\u2019ve been with my wife for 3 years and married for 1. until recently, she did not know i had this habit. this friday night, we were getting ready to have sex and we were both kind of stripping down, but in a corny and silly kind of way. we were both being very dramatic about taking off our clothes, and once i took my pants, i sensually took off the first pair of underwear slowly before taking off the second. she completely burst into laughter, and found the whole situation hilarious. she told me that i had way too much dedication to this sensual stripping but we were doing, but then i told her that the two pairs of underwear wasn\u2019t part of the bit, and i actually do that normally. she didn\u2019t believe me at first, and it took some pestering for her to finally realize i wasn\u2019t making this up. she said we\u2019ll talk about this later and we continued on with our sexual activities, however, i did notice some subtle signs of her being slightly less affectionate.\n\nanyways, yesterday we wake up, and all day she\u2019s questioning everything about my habit. she brings up things like how it doesn\u2019t make sense because i go through twice the amount of laundry, how it\u2019s uncomfortable, and how there probably isn\u2019t anyone else in the world who does this. i understand that what she\u2019s saying makes sense, but again, i mentioned to her that i tried to kick the habit and was very uncomfortable doing so, so i just stopped trying. she tells me that i barely gave it a chance, and that it just makes zero logistical sense to wear two pairs of underwear. i told her it isn\u2019t hurting anyone.\n\nafter this initial argument, she continues to complain to me about this issue. she starts getting gradually more angry about it as the day goes on, and what started out as playful ribbing turns into heated argument. she starts bringing up how it\u2019s gonna be a total turnoff in bed now because she won\u2019t be able to stop thinking about it, and she starts calling me a weirdo, which definitely hurt me. i know she\u2019s probably doing it to get me to stop wearing two pairs of underwear, but it still hurts regardless. the argument just keeps going in circles until i just say that i\u2019m done talking about it. she remains very angry for the rest of the night and basically doesn\u2019t talk to me and we just get into bed silently that night. it\u2019s this morning now, and she\u2019s not awake yet, but i\u2019m really starting to question whether i\u2019m actually in the wrong here or if she\u2019s overreacting and making a big deal out of a minor issue. aita?", "throwaway,\n\nme (29f) and my ex 'john' (33m) divorced last year because of infidelity, i'm now with my current partner 'tom' (41m). my brother 'mark' (31m) is good friends

he could bring me to the wedding in case something happens with my pregnancy. i told him that i wasn\u2019t going to sit through and watch someone who betrayed me celebrate love. my boyfriend

the father i never had. we'd talk a lot, hang out and go fishing/hunting whenever we'd visit her family and has always offered me advice when i needed it. we've grown very close over the year.\n\n3 years ago his wife had an affair and filed for divorce, it was a complete sucker punch to him and broke him. none of his children (3 daughters) chose his side and their mother turned them all against him. he was a hardworking man and as such didn't spend a lot of time at home so it wasn't too difficult for her to convince the children he didn't care about them.\n\nthe mother got re-married to the man she had an affair with and my fiancee invited them both. i asked her about inviting her father and she was completely against it. she claims it would cause too many issues and she can't have both of them there as they'll just fight. his other 2 daughters don't speak to him at all and my fiancee doesn't have a close relationship with him. on the other hand we speak at least once a week and have hung out a couple of times a year if he or i are near each other when on business trips.\n\ni've got no family to invite at all as they've all abandoned me and truthfully i see him as a father, so i decided to invite him myself. he was over-joyed and said he couldn't want to see us both. i told my fiancee and she blew her top saying i shouldn't have invited him and that he's fer father and not mine.", "the whole expulsion happened around 6 or 7 months ago, but it\u2019s still something that my husband brings up whenever we argue. \n\ni\u2019m gonna shorten the whole story on how she got expelled a little because it\u2019s a bit long, but in short, her and her friends bought a bunch of stink bombs, silly string, and eggs, and one day during a school-wide assembly, they snuck out and threw the stink bombs all over the school, silly stringed the whole place, and then went into the principals office and stink bombed, stringed, and egged the entire fucking place. they clearly didn\u2019t think it through though, because the place has cameras and they got caught. they did all this just to piss off the principal, which is so beyond stupid to me. \n\nthe next day my husband got a call and he had to go into the school. they told him that she was being expelled, and although he called me to tell me something, he only told me that she got into trouble. not that she was expelled. when i got home, i asked him about it and he told me what had happened. to be honest, i did get mad. i was beyond pissed at her for doing something like that and i let her know that. \n\nmy husband literally didn\u2019t do anything to her after he found out. he let her keep all of her things and didn\u2019t even talk to her about it, he just let me handle it all, which annoys me. i was the one who had to take all of her things, then after calming down i was the one who sat down with her and let her explain herself a little. after she explained, it really did trigger me all over again, because i just couldn\u2019t understand it. as soon as i started to raise my voice at her, my husband started to tell me that it\u2019s ok and that she\u2019s sorry and that it\u2019s fine now. i ended up yelling at him too because he kept trying to be her friend rather than her parent, and he argued back saying that if she apologized then we should leave it at that, and that i\u2019m doing too much. \n\nshe only recently got back her electronics and some privileges, but my husband keeps arguing with me saying that it was long ago and i need to just forget it. i still don\u2019t get his

\"you aren't a stem major so why are you even complaining? you haven't had a hard class till you've taken calc 3.\" now i'm not a stem major either, and i just felt tired of always being told my major

good to spend time with. we met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. first year we lived together, and have stayed friends since i moved out. after the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. he\u2019s not completely without his sight so it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it\u2019s just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he\u2019s not allowed to drive or get his license. he\u2019s completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can\u2019t drive. he\u2019s always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he\u2019d travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.\n\n\nnow my fianc\u00e9 and i have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. as is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and bobby received both. because i\u2019m not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. we had a few people who missed the rsvp date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. the rsvp date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. \n\n\nbackground backgrounded. now for the potential assholery.\n\n\nbobby also missed the rsvp date. he wasn\u2019t the only one i had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he\u2019s messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. the reason for his plus one is his eyesight. because he doesn\u2019t drive and he\u2019s not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. i flat out told him no, he\u2019s not inviting his mum as a plus one because we\u2019ve already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she\u2019s welcome at the rest of the day. \nthe hotel in reality doesn\u2019t need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there\u2019s no easy space to slot her in, and i don\u2019t want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. i now doubt whether he\u2019ll come, because i don\u2019t know if she\u2019s happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.\n\n\nam i the asshole?\n\n\n\n\n*", "there is a great little hole-in-the-wall pizza place in my neighborhood that i love. i\u2019ve been ordering pizza from them for years. sadly, i know they are hanging on by a thread because of the pandemic, so i try to support them by giving in to my pizza cravings more often, tipping the driver more, ordering more add-ons, etc. nothing extraordinary, just rooting for them to survive this thing. they appear on grubhub, but they do all of their own deliveries.\n\na friend of mine left town for thanksgiving (yeah, irresponsible, but not relevant for this post), so yesterday i was at her house to look in on her pets (cat and turtles). the cat seemed lonely, so i figured i\u2019d order a pizza and chill with him for a while. i couldn\u2019t order on grubhub because my friend\u2019s house is a couple of blocks outside the restaurant\u2019s standard delivery area (less than half a mile). i called and told the employee that i understood i was slightly outside their delivery area but i\u2019d be happy to pay any extra delivery fee they wanted and would tip the driver 30%. the employee pretty much said, \u201cno, sorry, you\u2019re outside our delivery area, bye\u201d and hung up.\n\ni\u2019m pretty positive they weren\u2019t busy (tuesday afternoon during a pandemic), i literally told the employee that i\u2019d pay extra and tip 30%, and this is a casual family-owned pizza joint, not some corporate franchise with rigid, unbendable policies. i understand why the employee said no, but i also kinda feel like the owner should know what happened, so he can decide if he wants to train the staff to handle that kind of thing differently in the future. at least until he\u2019s sure they\u2019re going to survive the pandemic.\n\nto be 100% clear, my goal isn\u2019t to complain or be a \u201ckaren\u201d. it\u2019s not even a complaint &amp; i'll absolutely remain as loyal a customer as i've always been! i totally understand that the employee did not do anything wrong, and i'd never dream of telling the owner if the place weren't struggling so badly. i just think if i were the owner, i\u2019d want a heads-up if my staff were turning down good business when the shop is so close to shutting down, just to avoid driving a few extra blocks. that said, i feel like an ah to snitch on some random employee who\u2019s probably making minimum wage, surely under enough stress, just trying to get through his shift. and maybe it would be wrong of me to encourage a business owner to push his employees to do more work than they signed up for. i\u2019m really torn.\n\nwibta if i tell the owner what happened?

delilah!) from the shelter two ish months ago. my cousin at the time was living in an apartment complex that didn't allow pets. my cousin was aware of this, but decided to get the dog anyway. surprise, she gets in trouble with the building a few days after adopting delilah. they tell her either the dog leaves, or she moves out. my cousin talked to different members of the family and asked if anyone could watch delilah while she looks for a new place to live. nobody was able to take in the dog so i offered to take her because i didn't want the poor thing to go to the shelter.\n\ni go pick up delilah and my cousin doesn't have any supplies to give me, just what is left of the dog food and her tags. whatever. i take delilah to where i'm living and get her settled. i go to the store and get her a collar, leash, bed, new food, bowls, toys, etc. i'm spending my own money, but i don't care because i want this puppy to be happy and comfortable. a week passes, and then more weeks pass. my cousin doesn't communicate with me often. i try to check in with her and she says she's working on finding a place. after several weeks my cousin said she has found a new apartment to move in to. she sends me the info to show me. it very obviously states that **they do not allow pets.** what the hell? i point this out to her and she insists they might change their mind since delilah is so well behaved (i was the one who had to train her since she was living with me.) i don't hear from my cousin for awhile again.\n\nhere we are now, about two months later. i am absolutely best friends with this dog, i love her more than anything. she is a quick learner and an absolute sweetheart. we've been on vet visits, i've been grooming her, spending my own money on everything she needs so i can take very good care of her. my cousin contacts me a few days ago and says she is ready to take delilah back. she tells me about her living situation and that she is living with her boyfriend and his buddies at their place. to make a long story short, they aren't a good crowd, and i didn't think it was a good idea for delilah to live there. i told my cousin that i was sorry but i felt uncomfortable sending delilah there, and that i have been caring for her and spending all of my own money on her for two months and frankly, i wanted to keep her.\n\nmy cousin was disgusted with me and called me a lot of swear words which i will not be repeating. she hasn't spoken to me since, but hasn't made any attempt to get delilah back either. i've been getting messages and calls from other cousins and aunts calling me a thief and saying i'm a horrible person.\n\n**aita for not returning the dog?** (also, i'm not worried about legal trouble, my family wouldn't do that and let's just say

first and only legal assistant until yesterday's events.\n\nmy employer recently hired a new associate who took it upon herself to treat me like absolute shit.  as a legal assistant, my duties are legal related, ie; editing and drafting documents, calendar management, processing client payments, filing documents at court, phone coverage, etc.  however, the new associate assigned me her personal duties:  grocery shopping, driving across town in traffic to buy her favorite chocolates, making returns to clothing stores, driving to her house to let maintenance technicians in, etc.  she yelled at me a lot.  i would get panic attacks and dreaded coming in to work.  i would have no problem performing these duties if i was a personal assistant, but i am a legal assistant and my objective is to ensure everyone in my firm has their legal responsibilities in order.\n\nat first i obliged, seeing as she was new and i figured my employer would have a word with her.  this went on for two months and every day i grew that much more resentful.  finally, i had a private meeting with my supervisor a few weeks ago and even typed up a note detailing my frustrations and how i am being taken advantage of.  he promised me he would speak with her, but her demands continued.\n\nyesterday was the last straw; while working at my desk, i overheard her talking about me to our receptionist.  she wasn't exactly pleasant - stating how i'm not up to par with her standards and how she spoke to my boss about me.  she was telling our receptionist how much they pay me and said she wants to lower my pay.  my blood started boiling and i could feel myself about to lose my shit.\n\ni have no idea what came over me, but i walked to over to our filing cabinet, pulled out all of our folders, and dumped all of their contents to the floor.  i imagine it was about 40-50 clients worth of papers.  i then grabbed my things and walked out of the office before telling the associate \"go fuck yourself, you stupid bitch.\"  she was absolutely shocked.\n\non my home, i was seething.  still pissed off when i got home, i texted my boss saying i will not be returning to work monday and that he'll have to find himself another assistant.  both her and she have tried calling, texting, and e-mailing me, but i haven't responded, except for one text where i sent her the middle finger emoji.  \n\nthis

rest of the date, there wasn\u2019t much effort in her remaining responses and she\u2019d give emotionless chuckles in response to my jokes. she also stopped asking questions. it was kinda like i was on a date with a magic 8 ball.\n\nwe split ways, and evidently she asked my friends why they would try to set her up with a construction worker. they were wondering why i didn\u2019t just tell her

feminine hygiene products and wash her underwear as the smell was becoming too much. and to be careful of getting bloodstains on the couch or anywhere she sits. i also noticed her sheets had a lot of

of hearing about the white dress, and that maybe if she put more effort into her own appearance she would have been a beautiful bride and people wouldn't be looking at her mil. she stormed off and my

all day and having friends over on weekend nights. \n\ni know when i play music or have friends over, some of the sound leaks through the walls. so i'd never get upset about hearing my neighbors because it goes both ways. \n\nso... when my boyfriend started coming over more often, he had complaints about the neighbors. which put me in an awkward place, he wanted to go speak to them or have me text them and i said no. \n\nfor example, one of the early times he stayed over we went to bed around 10. he wanted me to ask my neighbor to turn down her tv. i said she didn't have it that loud and she turns it off at midnight anyway. \n\nat 4 am, he got very irritated with my upstairs neighbor getting up and cooking breakfast. i said that he would be done by 5 because that's when his shift starts. \n\nat 7 am, he was still trying to sleep in and the neighbor on the other side had some work calls that he said he couldn't sleep through. i offered him earplugs and he said he couldn't sleep with them in either, he wanted me to ask her to quiet down.\n\nhe had similar comments every time he heard someone else in the building just living their life especially if it was when he was in bed. \n\ni got frustrated with my boyfriend and told him \"you know, you can't expect to date a 'hot young' 22 year old and not wanna deal with a 22 year olds living situation! i don't know if you realize but this is a normal apartment for someone my age... hell, my neighbors are pretty great; nobody's throwing loud parties on work nights, nobody's having screaming fights, nobody's having babies!\" \n\n(the 'hot young' part was in sarcastic air quotes because those were his words not mine)\n\nhe got irritated and asked why i was bringing age into it, and i said it's because he can't both want someone so young and also want someone with house kinda money! and he was being so out of touch with how normal people in their 20s live.\n\nhe got really irritated with me bringing age into it, and even more annoyed when i'd respond to his neighbor complaints in the future with \"ok boomer\" or tell him that if he wanted me to have a \"rich person apartment\" he could pay for it. \n\naita for what i said to my boyfriend about my apartment?", "i (27m) am the owner of a property that was formerly my grandpas home. my grandpa was a farmer and he had this awesome property built whenever my mom and her sisters were in high school. this was the family house, which my grandpa also built a giant garage on which my cousins have been using as a reception hall the last few years for their weddings. when my grandma died my grandpa and me started hanging more and i worked at the property since i was little. i am the only grandson he had. all my cousins on my moms side are girls. \n\nin 2018 my grandpa passed away and i was left the property. this caused a bunch of drama amongst the family. but i know exactly why my grandpa did it. my grandpa was not a perfect person. he was very old fashioned. hated divorce and was very traditional. his beliefs clashed with his daughters. he wanted to hand his farm down to a son. he didn\u2019t have any and none of my aunts married the type of dudes he liked. so i became the de facto option. my grandpa especially disliked how my aunts were in their relationships cause he preached commitment. that man loved and was loyal to my grandma. \n\nmy cousin (28f) is getting married this fall. i\u2019m at my parents house and my aunt goes \u201cwell the reception will be at the house\u201d. i told her nobody has talked to me yet. she said that since every other cousin had their reception there it should be a tradition. i said sure but they all asked me and i wanted them there. her daughter didn\u2019t ask me and i don\u2019t support the wedding. \n\nit\u2019s really legit reason. this is my cousins second wedding. i\u2019m not even close with her. we differ politically so i have her muted on social media. i didn\u2019t even know she was engaged. me and this cousin hardly speak. also this is her second marriage. she cheated on her first husband with this dude. who was also married at the time. my grandpa would never approve of that or want that on his property. also i would have to be involved in the set up and clean up if it\u2019s at the house. i don\u2019t care to sacrifice my time. if she wants to rent the property and my time. then she can pay me a premium for the short notice. but i\u2019m not doing it for free. \n\ni explained this all to my aunt and my cousin. they both threw a fit and tried having my mom talk to me. she tried pulling the family card and a guilt trip about my cousin having no money. i said my cousin has no money because of her divorce. it\u2019s a sham wedding and her dad wouldn\u2019t support it and she knows that. there was a reason that her dad didn\u2019t trust the property to his own kids. i said all my other cousins have been good people so i was willing to help. but this cousin and aunt are rude. my mom said i won\u2019t be invited to christmas most likely then. i said okay find another venue while you are at it (the house is the hangout spot for christmas). my dad is calling me an ah but i need to a fair judgment. aita?", "my wife wants to quit her job. she wants to be a sahm to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.\n\n\nin order for her to do that, i would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on saturdays. i told her that i if she quits her job then i expect her to cover all the housework. i may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. i will will help out on weekends but during weekdays i rather rest. \n\n\nmy wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and i am being lazy and discriminative against women. i don't really mean that, as i think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. i will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. aita?", "i (27f) was using a dating app and a guy i'd been chatting with asked me out on a dinner date, and i accepted. we met up at a thai restaurant that he picked, and the server came over to take our orders. she asked me what i'd like to drink and i ordered what i vaguely remember being the second-least expensive glass of white wine on the menu. he seemed uneasy and just ordered water, it then occurred to me to ask whether he drank because i didn't want to make him uncomfortable in case he was in recovery/didn't drink for religious reasons/etc. he said he sometimes did so no issue. when the server took our food orders, i once again ordered first and ordered something that was probably right in the middle of the general menu prices. he ordered soup, which was listed under the starters section as his meal. i figured he had a late lunch or was maybe nervous since it was a first date.\n\nin our conversation i found out he was currently between jobs. no worries, he'll find a new one and his previous company is known in the area for paying well above market rates so his finances didn't seem like a huge concern. like i always do on a first date, i suggested we split the check and he said fine but didn't look too happy about it. i was texting him the next day and he seemed kind of cold so i asked if anything was wrong. he basically told me i should have picked up the whole check since i \"ate so much more\" (a meal and one drink does not seem excessive) and \"much more expensive food\" (think an $18 entree vs his $10 soup) and said he didn't think he wanted to see me again.\n\nhonestly, i think splitting it was fair since he had been the one to ask me out, he had chosen the restaurant, and my order seemed completely reasonable to me. aita for not paying the whole check?\n\nediting to address all of the

(the sink is across the room from the toilet so it's unlikely to be from the sink.) at first i thought it might be water but soon realized that it was definitely pee. i asked bf about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim. i asked him to try a little harder and he said sure.\n\nthe floor continued to be frequently spattered with piss, and a few weeks later i confronted him about it again because i think it's pretty gross to step in his pee several times a week, and it seems like an easy thing to fix. if he misses the toilet, i think the very least he could do is make sure to wipe it up with toilet paper or a clorox wipe. (the cleaning supplies even live in a cabinet directly over the toilet.) he said sure, sorry, he would try to remember to do that. \n\nanother week has passed and while maybe he's doing this sometimes, i've continued to step in splatters of his pee and wipe it off the floor and clean the floor several times a week. i thought about asking him to just pee into the bathtub or something instead, because i don't understand how you can pee on the floor by accident so often and not notice and not clean it up.\n\nlast night i got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and absolutely stepped in piss for the 12312301298th time. i had had it and i didn't want to pick a fight or ask him again since it seems clear he can't or won't change, so i got one of my dog's wee-wee pads from when he was a puppy (he is well trained now) and cut it up a bit and taped it down to make a sort of \"skirt\" or mat around the floor near the toilet to at least absorb the piss. \n\nbf saw this morning and is furious with me, saying that i'm calling him a dog, comparing him to an animal, etc. honestly, i was not thinking that at all, i just was trying to be resourceful and solve the problem for myself since i don't like piss on my bathroom floor and don't like stepping in it, i didn't feel like arguing about it anymore, and putting a material specifically meant to absorb pee around the area he keeps peeing on by accident seemed like a practical solution. \n\naita?", "i\u2019ve been terrified of dogs since i was young. my husband knew but i don\u2019t think he realised how bad it was until recently. he got our son a dog and at first, i was angry but he promised it wouldn\u2019t come near me and our son was really happy so i agreed they could keep it as long as it was

now since he broke his promise and i didn\u2019t trust him to keep it away from me anymore.\n\nmy husband doesn\u2019t want to get rid of it because our son is very attached to it already and the dog is harmless according to him. he wants me to let him take me around the dog so that i\u2019ll stop being so scared of it but i\u2019ve refused and told him it had to go. we argued and he told me that if i wanted it gone, i would have to take it myself.\n\nmy in-laws came to visit yesterday and my mother-in-law asked me if something had happened between us because i\u2019m still angry at him and she noticed. i told her about the dog and she told him off and said she taught him better than to traumatise his pregnant wife. now my husband is upset at me because he thinks i only told his parents

definitely isn't a fair situation and she doesn't get any time to herself. \n\nanyway, the situation is as this: my sister invited me to hang out on saturday night. i agreed to come around and hang out with her, but she said she would have to leave to run an errand at some point. cool. she said she'd be half an hour so could i look after the sleeping youngest child while she quickly nipped out? i reluctantly agreed. the other two kids had been dropped off at our parents for the weekend, so i understood she would want some time to run an errand she normally wouldn't have time for. as long as it was only half an hour. she promised it would be. \n\ni come over, we chat and catch up and watch a movie. it's really pleasant until she says she has to leave for that errand, and leaves me instructions of what to do in case the kid wakes up but says to just call her because she's only around the corner. i'm really on edge about it because i struggle a lot with really bad anxiety and panic disorder, which i'm currently in therapy for and experimenting with meds to manage, however we haven't found anything that really works yet. she knows this and knows i would really panic and cannot look after a kid for longer than she initially promised, i'm just not there mentally to be able to deal with crying for example.\n\nanyway half an hour passes and she isn't back yet. 45 mins. i call her and ask if everything is ok and when she will be back, and she answers after multiple rings. she said something came up and she'd be another hour, maybe an hour and 15. i basically lose my shit and say if she's not back in 15 minutes then i'm leaving. she said i wouldn't do that and to please just stay there and hung up. at this point i'm on the verge of having a panic attack so do my breathing exercises, ring her husband, leave a message when he doesn't answer, text him about the situation as well and also text my mom and leave after 15 minutes as i said. \n\napparently my sister

fuming i went into the kitchen and confronted them, they acted confused but i was able to get the wig back. i lashed out telling them they humiliated my wife and barrassed her by taking away her wig. they said it was just lighthearted prank which made me go off on them. my sister got involved and said my wife was just being too sensitive and the girls were just curios to see her without a wig but she overreacted. i told her her daughters were recording her! she saw nothing wrong in it and said i overreacted as well. i lost it on her too and told her she and my nieces are no longer welcome to

had a meet up with my mom and sister to eat lunch and that i won't be home, she said she needed to go be with him and i kind of flipped out at her and said that she doesn't \"need\" to be with him and could literally go see him at home the next day or something. she threw a fit and called me cruel for forcing her to leave anthony by himself since she's all he has and that i was making her look bad. she also said my appointment with mom and sister wasn't as important as a chemo session but i decided to just leave to end the argument.\n\nshe ended up staying at home but kept ignoring me when i got back calling me selfish for not letting her be there to support anthony with what he's going through. some of her girlfriends think i'm being a controlling jerk with no consideration for anthony and

said that she didn\u2019t need it that she was confident she could hold it and that she\u2019d be careful. i told her there\u2019s no way she could be 100% certain that she wouldn\u2019t have an

colors were fuschia and sky blue.  i asked my brother about it and he said it was just something he and his fiance wanted and thought it would be fun to have a color-coordinated wedding.  \n\nthe problem i have with this is that i only wear black and white. like, i literally do no own any clothing that is not black, white, or a combination of the two.  i do not own any clothes that are blue or bright pink.  i told my brother about this long before the wedding and he just told me that i have plenty of time to find something that will fit the color scheme.  \n\nit was like he has no care for the fact that i don't wear those colors at all.  i complained about it to my parents and my mom offered to take me shopping to find something to wear and she told me it was just one day and that wearing something a different color for a few hours is not going to kill me.  when we went shopping i hated everything she made me try on and she ended up just buying a couple things in the two colors and brought them home.  \n\nthe morning of the wedding i refused to put either thing on.  i had brought my favorite black dress that was more than nice enough for any wedding and decided to wear that instead.  both my mom and dad told me to put on something else, but i refused and eventually my parents just dropped it and told me they didn't want to fight about it anymore.\n\nwe arrived at the venue early for pictures and my mom ran off right away to find my brother.  i assume to warn him that i didn't adhere to his color scheme.  so when we were doing family pictures, my brother made a point to tell me that i would not be involved in any of the larger group shots with the wedding party and the rest of our family.  he told me that he's fine with me being in pictures with just our family, but that i would stand out too much in all of the other group shots because i was literally the only person who didn't wear their preferred colors.\n\ni knew this was probably his bride making the decision and i called my brother out on it.  he told me it was his wedding day and he wasn't going to fight with me about it and that this was just the way it is.  he told me he was disappointed that i couldn't do one little thing for him on his wedding day and i told him he was an asshole for making people dress a certain way even if they don't want to.  \n\ni got a lot of weird looks from people during the ceremony and reception.  and my brother and his wife pretty much avoided me completely the entire time.  even my parents kept their distance from me.  i really don't think i did

meals for the kids. last night dinner was baked chicken, squash and whole grain rice. right before bed son wants to eat again, so he went into the kitchen and made half a box (so about 8-10 oz) of dried pasta, which, once cooked, is a ton of pasta. he drowned it in olive oil and red wine vinegar and mixed in salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. then he poured half a jar of olives on top. so just carbs, fat and salt basically.\n\nmy husband came downstairs, saw what he was eating and got upset. he said \"christ (son), eat a vegetable!\"\n\nson got defensive and said olives are vegetables. my husband said they aren't real vegetables. they were getting heated so i stepped in and said he had a healthy meal earlier and will burn it all off at practice tomorrow anyway. my husband turned on me and said \"this is your fault. if you weren't too lazy to make the kid a snack he wouldn't be eating that crap. he's going to have a heart attack at forty.\" then he stormed off.\n\nmy husband's comments hurt my feelings. what's worse, my sister agrees with him. she said i could have made him a salad and it wouldn't have taken long. i just really don't think it's that bad because he eats healthy three times a day, and he burns off all the carbs and fat at practice. i know that was a lot of salt though... aita? am i just justifying because i'm lazy?", "my family is black (african, but not african american. i think this makes a difference. aka, not descendant from black american slaves). we live in canada. however, we were visiting my cousins that live in the uk but used to live in italy at this time. \n\nwe're all around 17-22 in this story. anyways, me, my sister, and 2 of my cousins were walking around in the uk talking about racism (which is very prevalent, don't get me wrong) and my cousin asked me if i've ever had a racist experience. i hesitated and said no. this is because i don't like to assume people are racist. \n\nof course there's been instances where people have been cold to me for seemingly no reason, and sure, they totally could have been racist but i don't like to assume racism. maybe i'm annoying, maybe they don't like my personality, etc., you know? and i've never had anything undeniably racist said to me before which is why  i said no. my sister rolled her eyes and said \"op doesn't think people are racist, she just thinks they're having a bad day.\" \n\ni don't doubt that my cousins have had legitimate racist encounters because i know that italians are a bit more known for being racist than people in canada (of course though, there are good and racist people in both countries). \n\nmy sister just assumes that if someone doesn't like her, they must be racist. basically, i told her that just because someone doesn't like her doesn't mean they're racist. maybe they just don't like her personality, etc. my sister thinks i'm delusional and an asshole. i'm not trying to invalidate her experience, i guess i just try to see the best in people and i don't let maybe racist people get in my head like she does.\n\naita?", "i have a son i haven\u2019t seen in six years and he is dead to me. if anyone asks if we have children i say we have one daughter and that\u2019s it. he married a woman neither of us liked, made terrible financial decisions, and ended up having to move in with us. we let him live there for six months until my wife and dil ended up in a screaming match over lipstick, and obviously it wasn\u2019t really about the lipstick but i couldn\u2019t take it anymore. i asked them to leave (not immediately but to make plans)\n\nmy son said that i couldn\u2019t evict him legally and i reassured him that i didn\u2019t mean that night, i just wanted him to figure it out. he said they were tenants because they had lived with us for over 30 days, now it is slightly my fault for not knowing the law, but in my opinion my son is the scum of the earth. we had to go through a long court process and it was months before we could get him out. living in that house was hell. my wife screamed all the time and it was just unbearable. i told my son the day he left to never contact me again. i don\u2019t care if he\u2019s terminally ill and needs a kidney, i\u2019m not his father.\n\nwell everything has been great for six years but dil had a baby and he called me wife crying about how much he misses us and that he wants us to meet his son. my wife agreed though when i asked her about it she admitted that she really doesn\u2019t want to meet the baby she just felt guilty. she is now begging me to go with her, because she\u2019s uncomfortable, but i never want to see either of them again and that baby is nothing to me.", "my parents pretty much hate my wife. they will be civil if we invite them to something, though they skipped our wedding, but she is not allowed in their house, or in either of my sister's houses. my mom has a ton of siblings and she has all of my aunt's and uncle's against her as well.\n\ni know my parents sound kind of crazy, but i feel like they are justified because five years ago, right before the wedding, she tried to steal all of their pets (two cats and a dog) the dog hurt its paw and she was convinced that my parents story didn't make sense. i get that she loves animals and has had work experience, but we had pets my whole childhood and i have never seen my parents mistreat them. they were treated better than me sometimes. also i have a weird story about breaking my wrist in college, sometimes weird accidents just happen.\n\nthe police had to be called and my little sister who was 11 at the time was really upset and scared they wouldn't get the pets back. my wife is now banned from their house, and pretty much everyone in my family's home. the other day my mom invited me over for my dad's birthday. my wife sometimes gets upset when i go places that she isn't invited. she said i was being selfish, so i told her point blank that it is her fault they hate her, and i went anyway.", "here's the backstory.\n\nin mid-november this year i got laid off. as part of my redundancy package the firm let me keep my company macbook pro (after wiping it, obvs). i'd only been with them for a year, so the laptop on which i type this missive to you now is also barely a year old. \n\nthe good news - four weeks later i managed to get a new job. after an extremely stressful month it's all worked out pretty well as i've secured a small pay rise, at a bigger firm, starting next month. the new gig will also give me a new laptop to work from. they are a deep tech firm, and in my contract there are quite clear stipulations about not using my computer for personal purposes, security risks, etc etc. fairly standard stuff.\n\non hearing that i'll be getting a new laptop, yesterday my wife said, \"great, so i can use your macbook from now on.\" my wife works part time, three days a week, and studies to complete a certification in the rest of her time. i agreed to support her on this when she herself got let go back in september, and i'm currently shouldering almost all of our household outgoings (mortgage, utilities, taxes, etc).\n\ni mention this to show how she can't easily just go out and buy her own at the moment. my wife uses an older macbook air to work/study from. admittedly, it is a little slow now, but she uses chrome (google docs, login to her school portal), the spotify app, and that's about it. in other words, she really does not need a powerful computer. at all.\n\nhere's the issue - my \"old\" macbook is now my personal computer, and frankly, i don't want to just give it away. she doesn't seem to get this, and doesn't understand why i can't just let her have it as i'm 'getting a new one anyway'. but my new work laptop is for work, and honestly, i want to keep my personal and work machines separate. and to be more honest, i feel it's a bit entitled on her part to just assume that she gets to keep it now.\n\nat the same time, i am her husband, and i do want her to be happy. maybe i should just suck it up and be a good provider. but man, i like this computer. i'm thinking i should offer to help her get a new chromebook or something instead. but you tell me, aita?  \n\n\n**tldr** \\- got to keep my work macbook when i got canned. now i'm getting a new work laptop from a new job, but it's for work purposes only. wifey wants to take my 'old' macbook for herself, but i want to keep it for personal use. aita?"], "prediction_texts": ["esh. you can't expect your brother and sister to have the
