{"submission_texts": ["i (31f) am the oldest of four sisters (30, 28, 25). my middle sisters both married before me, and i got married last may. at each of our weddings, our \"something old\" was a flower-shaped hair pin that belonged to our mom. our mom passed away when we were teens, so having that pin was a way for each of us to include her memory in our special days. since i got married most recently, i have the pin at my apartment.\n\nlast week, my youngest sister announced her engagement in our family group chat, then texted me to ask that i send her the pin.\n\nhere's the thing. all my sisters were my bridesmaids, along with some friends. at my bachelorette party, after my friends had left, my sisters and i stayed up, a little drunk and feeling very deep in that post-party kind of way. we started talking about our mother. my middle sisters and i got emotional, saying how much we missed her. my youngest sister, however, was very quiet.\n\ni asked her what was up, and she started talking about how she was always our mom's least favorite, how even when mom was dying she didn't say \"as good\" a goodbye to her as she did to the rest of us, and how \u2013 if mom had lived \u2013 they'd probably have a terrible relationship. my middle sisters and i tried to talk her out of it, saying that of course our mother loved her and stuff like that, but finally my little sister kind of snapped and just shouted, \"look, i hated that fucking bitch, okay?\" then she started crying and went home.\n\nthe next day, i called my sister. i asked her if she'd meant everything she'd said the night before. she said she did. she said that she knew our mother loved her, and she knew our mother never did anything \"bad\" to her, but that she could always tell that our mom \"secretly regretted having a fourth kid.\" she suspected our mom had wanted a son, and had been disappointed by a fourth girl. personally, i don't believe this is true. as the oldest, i had a lot of conversations with my mom before she died that my sisters weren't party to, and she always said that she would have loathed having boys. in fact, i always thought that my youngest sister was her favorite.\n\nmy sister ended the conversation saying, \"look, that woman might have been my mom, but i didn't like her very much.\"\n\ni responded to my sister's text about the pin saying that i wasn't sure why she wanted to wear it, considering her strained relationship with our mother's memory. my sister responded, \"all of you wore it. i should wear it too.\" i don't think she should wear it just because we did. it's supposed to represent our mom's memory, and if she doesn't look at our mom's memory fondly, i don't want her disrespecting the pin by wearing it dishonestly. i told her that i would hold onto the pin for now, and we could discuss it more later if she reflects more on what the pin actually represents.\n\naita?", "\n\ncontext: my husband [33] used to be unemployed for a year, he recently started a job at a warehouse. \n\nyesterday, and while i was about to do the laundry, i grabbed his work pants and digged my hand in it's pockets to empty them before putting it in the washing machine like i\u00a0 always do. \n\nmy husband just happened to walk by and when he saw me searching his pants pockets. he rushed in yelling at me to put his pants down. i already had a folded piece of paper out but he snatched it then started screaming at me about how i have no respect for his privacy and that i shouldn't be getting my hands on his things. i was genuinly dumbfounded i told him to take it easy i alwaye do this before laundry. he lashed out saying i had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one i pulled out. i said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. i asked why and he said i don't get to ask him jack shit after i disrespected his privacy. i almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? it wasn't like a stranger was digging into them. \n\nhe refused to speak to me and later brought a new closet with a lock and moved his clothes inside of it. i asked if he was serious and he said this will teach me to respect his privacy and deter my snooping. then went back to not speaking to me.\n\n\ni'm genuinely confused, aita?", "i was recently flying from nyc to lax for a work trip and i had the displeasure of sitting next to a family and a little boy (9). i got on the plane in the midst of issues with my diabetes and i needed to eat within two hours so i began snacking. i immediately began receiving dirty looks from the parents and the mother said \u201ccan you not do that? our son.\u201d so i put my food away and figured i\u2019d wait until the flight attendant came around so i could buy food from her and eat at an acceptable time just to show some respect for their wishes.  \n\nso the flight attendant comes by with her beverages and snacks, i start to ask for a coke and a snack box, but before i can finish the sentence the father says \u201cnothing for this row, we\u2019re all set here\u201d and she continues on. i go up to press the call light so i can get my food and my drink because i actually need it and the father says \u201cour son has prader-willi, we\u2019d prefer it if you didn\u2019t eat because it causes tantrums when he doesn\u2019t know he can\u2019t eat and he\u2019s always hungry\u201d. i\u2019m close to a tantrum myself at this point and so i look him in the eye and say \u201ci do not care, fly private if you want to control your surroundings\u201d. \n\nthe flight attendant comes back and i get my food and my drink, i snarf it down and chug my soda, and i sit back. as soon as i\u2019m calmed and i\u2019m able to open my laptop and get back to work the mother leans in and says \u201ci feel a calling to educate you about my son\u2019s disease\u201d and i felt my entire body clench up. she keeps talking to me and explaining how i\u2019d made her son feel and i said \u201clisten lady, i don\u2019t fucking care, i\u2019m going to handle my t1d the way i see fit and you\u2019re going to handle your son the way you see fit. i\u2019m not endangering myself because you don\u2019t want to deal with a tantrum, if you want to control other people then you book all the seats in a row or you fucking fly private.\u201d\n\ni recounted the story to a friend of mine once i\u2019d gotten off the plane and she immediately told me that i was a huge ah and i should\u2019ve given them a little bit of grace due to their son\u2019s condition. i kind of feel bad but at the same time, i think that it\u2019s unavoidable if you\u2019re going into public and you\u2019re around others. \n\naita?", "ok, so i know the title sounds bad, but bear with me - i had my reasons.\n\nso, i (22m) have been really struggling to find a job since i graduated this summer. i'm searching in a highly competitive field (think finance), and yesterday was the first time i interviewed somewehre.\n\ni took a small shot of absinthe when i woke up, just to settle my nerves a little. (side note - my grandad was of czech origin, and he loved absinthe. he even used to brew it himself. my final birthday present from him was a novel 200 ml bottle he brought from his homeland. unfortuantely, he passed away a couple weeks ago, so i decided to pour one out for him to ensure good luck in my interview.)\n\nhowever, by the time i was sat in the company's waiting room, the effects had completely worn off. i started to feel sick with nerves - the pressure of the interview stage was getting to me after months of writing applications. i decided to sneak off to the toilet to take a couple of pre-interview shots to calm my nerves. the interview that followed actually went really well - i had great chemistry with the interviewer, and we were laughing, flirting etc.\n\nthe problem came when i, very stupidly, decided to sneak in another shot (for good luck) before the final interview with the ceo. sadly, she emerged from her office precisely as i was mid-gulp. she looked horrified, and told me to leave the building. i tried to explain to her about my anxiety, and how i was simply medicating it, but she wouldn't listen and called security to take me away. afterwards, i sent the company an apology e-mail and asked for another chance, but they haven't yet replied.\n\nmy mother thinks i'm an asshole for drinking at all and called me an alcoholic,

house in this city costs at least $1m so that is completely off the table. the house that we live in has 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom and 1 kitchen/living room. \n\nmy husband and i live in one of the bedrooms while my daughter and son live in the other one. both of the bedrooms are the same size and are rather small but my husband and i are both grown adults and we can both fit together in one of the rooms just fine. the problem now is that my daughter thinks that her room is too small and doesn't want to share it with her younger brother. i asked her about what she wanted to do about this problem and she suggested that her brother moves to the living room couch but i said that i cant just kick him out of his room because his sister wants it for herself. i suggested that we could put up office-style cubicle dividers or a curtain to divide the room in two if she wants privacy but then we both realized that this would be a bad idea since they both share a bunk bed since the room is way too small to realistically fit 2 beds. so, in the end i told her that she can either stay in the room with her brother or she can be the one who moves to the living room since it wouldn't be fair to kick him out because she wants his room to herself. i understand that she wants more space and privacy but what can i do?\n\nso, reddit aita?", "i (m24) had an auto accident over 2 years ago that resulted in a left leg knee amputation, i thought that would been the end of my active lifestyle, i loved all kinds of sports as a kid and i still do.\ni had a very hard time adjusting to my new normal, my parents were able to get me a prosthetic leg that allowed me to get back to running and going trips with my friends like we always do every summer.\n\n\nthe guys were planning an rv trip on the weekend, we had already chosen a destination which was spending some time out in nature and getaway from stress.\n\n\nmy girlfriend asked if she could come along, i told her no, this is a guy's trip, told all my buddies' girlfriends wanted to go but they were firm and put their foot down, she laughed at me for this then tried to convince me to let her come cause she was feeling stressed out from being at home 24h, i already made up my mind, i wasn't going to ruin the trip just because she wants to be on a guy's trip, i promised her a trip when i get back, she got upset and didn't like the idea.\n\nlater on, before i went to sleep, i took my prosthesis off as i do every night, this is my second prothesis, i've already completed a wearing schedule during first year and had to get another prothisis to accommodate any physical changes i had.\n\ni woke up in the morning and i couldn't find my prosthesis, i looked where i put it but it was gone, i asked my girlfriend who was doing heavy cleaning around the place, and she said she didn't see it, i was confused it was near my bed, i asked her to stop being childish and playing games and give back my prosthesis because i knew she took it.\n\nshe's a bad liar couldn't even deny it, she said she wanted to hide it so that i won't go on that trip and leave her alone. i got mad at her for this, i was stunned to find my prosthesis hidden underneath an auto part in the garage, it had been damaged, it was placed in a possession where it had a crack, it was abvious it no longer functions properly, i mean i could still wear it but can't put my whole weight on it cause it would break.\n\ni yelled at her and showed her what she did, she said she didn't mean it, i told her she did mean it because she was being childish and jealous over a trip and now she caused me 7000$ worth damage, i told her she ruined everything, that she owed me a new one and that she needed to pay for a new one.\n\nshe got mad and left, i basically had to use my old crutches it felt absolutely horrible, i called the guys and told them i wasn't coming, it's been a few days, she's mad that i'm still asking her to pay for a new prosthesis and called me an a**** for not apologizing and preferring a \"plastic leg\" over her.\n\ni had to call my parents today to tell them they told me she should at least help pay half the expense of a new prosthesis since she caused damage to it, and then consider my relationship with her.\n\nhave i been an a**** to her ?", "as you know, french bulldogs have breathing issues due to their deformed noses.\n\ni saw a girl jogging with her french bulldog. i told my wife i wanted to say something, but she said not to, so i didn't.\n\na few days later, i saw the same girl and dog around my neighborhood walking, so i took this chance to say something. i told her to please consider her dog's breathing issues when jogging. she told me when she jogs with him, she does intervals of light jogging for 1 min then does 3 mins of walking for 15-20 mins and she only does this every two weeks. never in the summer.\n\ni see where she's coming from, but i told her he's probably not doing too good. she then says he runs constantly in dog parks for more than an hour so he's fine. i told her thats different. she says \"ok i hear you - have a great day!\". honestly this is a rude response since i feel dismissed. so i ask if she's going to stop. she says probably not. at this point i'm mad so i tell her she shouldn't have gotten this breed then.\n\nshe then says \"yea sure.\" then walks away.\n\ni told my wife about this and she said this is one of the dumbest thing i could've done and i should've minded my own business.\n\nso, was i in the wrong?", "i have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only i can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. all the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but i told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.\n\nthings worked pretty well at first but over time i caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. after the third or so time i sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. they all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and i told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.\n\ni came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. i see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead i just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. after this during the middle of the night i took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. it took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. \n\nqueue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. queue bitching. queue tantrums and accusations about me being a \"dicklord\". i don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. i'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when i regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think i'm an ass for good now and i had only created an awkward situation that won't go.\n\ni have no regrets, and i don't think i'm an ass, but given i lurk this sub a lot i'm curious for your verdict in this matter. aita?", "my daughter is 21f and lives in another city for

away but i wasn\u2019t up to it so i said no ask your brother (her brother is perfectly fine, no flu), a while later she came back saying he said no and asked if she could just drive by herself since it\u2019s so close and shouldn\u2019t be a big deal since she has a license and it\u2019s only 6:30 pm. i still said no after which she got angry and said it\u2019s not fair that we don\u2019t spend any time with her and she\u2019s been trapped at home because we\u2019re sick and that it must not even be serious since we attended a wedding thats outside our city and yet i wont go to a store thats

apathetic towards most things and my husband took notice of that quickly after they have met and has brought it up to me a few times. noticing her reaction or lack there of my husband let out a groan and said. \"you could at least pretend to be happy, that's what normal people do.\"\n\nmy daughter just looked at him for a few seconds and then left the room without a word. i didn't think much of it

clothes back, she refused and tried to leave but i closed the door and told her and my ex she wasn't going. later that night my ex called ranting about how my daughter had called him crying about how she didn't want to live with me and my husband anymore.\n\nshe told him he was mean and drought up the fact that he would often call her 'sophiopath' -her name is sophia - and that i just let him and

apologize for what he said which he did but got visibly frustrated when she just stared at him until he felt to room.\n\nafter the weekend was over my ex brought our son back for school and he asked

novelty. \n\nwell a friend\u2019s friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would

someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to

pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. \n\ni'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too

our appetizers and entrees at the same time, and i made sure to tell our server to please pace the meal so that our apps and entrees were not served with each other.\n\nthe apps come and 5 minutes after that, all of our entrees were being served. now all of us were a little frustrated given the fact that i told the server to pace the meal appropriately. we asked that they be taken back and that they wait for us to finish our apps. the server takes the entrees back and 2 min later, a food runner now brings us the same food that we had just sent back. we politely told him that we are still eating our appetizers and so he brings it back to the kitchen again. \n\nso we finish our apps and now are ready for the entrees. about 20 min go by and we have nothing. our server hadn\u2019t come by to check on us at all and at this point we were both ready for another round and still hungry. finally, only my entree comes out (nobody else\u2019s) and my food is ice cold. i had wrongly assumed that my food was sitting on the hot plate waiting for me as opposed to just off to the side in the kitchen. \n\nnow i had tried calling our server over but she didn\u2019t come over until everyone else got their food. i told our server that my food was cold and without skipping a beat, she responded with verbatim \u201cit\u2019s not cold.\u201d she hadn\u2019t felt the plate or the food itself and so i was taken aback by the resentment towards me. \n\nso now i was really angry and we end up calling over a manager over who is being very nice. we told her we hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to order another round and she offered to buy this next round for us and take my pasta off the bill. we told her we all wanted a refill on our margaritas. \n\n10 min later our server brings us 5 little shots of tequila and says \u201cmy manager wanted me to tell you that this is your next round on us\u201d. now i was confused because i thought we were getting margs but whatever free alcohol is free alcohol. but of course one of my friends goes \u201coh these were supposed to be margaritas\u201d. our server looks at us and straight up says \u201cyou know what i\u2019m done with you guys\u201d and walks away. \n\nwe see the manager so we ask her for our check because our server was full on avoiding us at that point. our server then comes to our table, hands us our check and is very nice and happy like nothing ever happened. i said \u201cwait i thought you were done with us\u201d and she replies \u201coh yea i forgot\u201d and walks away.\n\nthe manager cashes us out, and i was just so angry in the heat of the moment that i stiffed our server out of a tip which i would never do but i felt in that it was the only thing i could do just from the disrespect we had gotten. if we were a pain in the ass i get it but the attitude was straight up unprofessional. \n\naita for acting this way in this situation?", "throwaway account but i need some opinions.\n\ni (26f) have been with my

falling out last year. we used to be really close, but she pulled a complete 180 on me and went behind my back. when i confronted her about it back then, she looked completely confused and asked what she did and how she can fix it. i wanted to believe her but i felt that she should\u2019ve known already why i was mad at her. my boyfriend is still close to both his best friend and the fianc\u00e9e to this day since he\u2019s known them before dating me. he mentioned that he could bring me to the wedding in case something happens with my pregnancy. i told him that i wasn\u2019t going to sit

going to the wedding, then he shouldn\u2019t be his best man and should prioritize me and the baby. he dropped the conversation after that.\n\ni told some of my friends this, and they said though the pregnancy is important for him to be attentive to, i should move on from the drama and let him be there for his best friend\u2019s big day. i still stand firm because it\u2019d be awkward with his

separated when my second was born. we had pretty equal custody for the next two years, then i got an amazing job offer in another state. i was able to work out a plan with my ex where i had the kids for the school year and she got them for christmas and the summer. she did not want to move, but she let me take the kids because there were much better education opportunities and housing options where i moved to.\n\nthis has been out plan for the last 4 years. my wife and i do pretty much all of the parental hard work like homework and discipline while my ex gets to take them on trips and treat them on breaks. it's tough, but i'm closer with the kids than she is. i also feel bad that my wife, who has raised both kids for almost their entire lives, and who has put in so much effort, gets no credit. she doesn't have any legal claim to the kids and if i died, she might never be able to see them again.\n\nthis has been bothering me for a while and i really want my wife to be able to legally adopt my children. she is their primary caretaker and does the majority of the hard work, and my kids love her and call her \"mom.\" i very gently breached the idea with my ex that she sign over her parental rights to my wife. i told her we would still make custody agreements so she could see the kids in the summer and i would never cut them off from her, but she hasn't done the hard work of raising them like my wife has. my ex went nuts me like i've never seen before and accused me of parental alienation. she never once expressed interest in moving to where i am in the last 4 years, but now she's saying she's going to move to my state and use my request as evidence that i'm alienating the kids. when i told my wife, i thought she'd appreciate my gesture but she's mad at me too and says i was out of line. was an i being an asshole just by asking? i would have dropped it if she had just said no, but i wasn't expecting such a shit show.", "my girlfriend started going to therapy for anxiety and such. i usually ask what they talked about when we talk about our days, and she told me she told her therapist about the ins and outs of our relationship, including sex and

his dad owns several successful businesses. he\u2019s not a snob, but recently he\u2019s become a bit preachy about how it\u2019s better to be an entrepreneur than an employee. \n\nwe\u2019ve talked about it several times before. i\u2019ve been working for a financial company for 9 years, and he always asks me about when i would put up my own business. i told him that i enjoy my current job because i get paid alright, have a great time with my coworkers and learn many things from my clients. j said that i\u2019m wasting my time working for a company that pays me so little compared to what i could earn if were a business owner. i told him that i do have plans of having my own business someday, but that requires a large amount of capital and is a huge risk that i\u2019m not yet comfortable taking. he said that i\u2019ve been an employee for 9 years, so \u201cif not now, when?\u201d and that you can only get the reward if you take the risk. \n\ni usually try to brush things off because i know that j has good intentions, he\u2019s just a little out of touch with how hard it can be to put up your own business and be successful at it, since his dad\u2019s businesses have been there all his life. but the other day he was telling me about one of his cousins who asked for advice on college majors. he told me that he told his cousin to go for a business degree, work for two years to get some experience and then have his own business, just like j said he did. he also told his cousin to remember to aspire for greater things and not be satisfied with being an employee forever.\n\ni was a bit irked about the last part and told him that hey, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being an employee \u2018forever\u2019 and not everyone is cut to or wants to be a business owner. he said yes, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being an employee forever, but if you\u2019re smart or have any ambition, you would want to have your own business instead of working for someone else your whole life.\n\ni told j that if he thinks that being a business owner is the best way to succeed financially, then why hasn\u2019t he put up his own business? he said that he does have his own business, referring to the construction firm his dad founded which he now manages, and he doesn\u2019t have to put up a new one since his family already has one in place. i asked how it\u2019s his if he isn\u2019t the registered owner, needs approval from his dad for all major decisions, and doesn\u2019t control the company\u2019s income. i said that he\u2019s basically an employee who happens to be related to the owner and the monthly allowance he gets for running the business is his salary.\n\nhe didn\u2019t reply to me after that and hasn\u2019t talked to me since. aita?", "just for some background, my family is a bit larger. we are all pretty healthy people, but we are not naturally thin. both of my parents are bigger, i\u2019m a bit bigger, and growing up my sister was to. \n\nnow my sister works hard to fight being a bigger. she eats like a rabbit, and does pretty crazy workouts. people tend to look up to her for keeping her weight down and \u201cgetting healthy\u201d but

about her body for a while. she\u2019s a bit chubby like myself. it makes me sad, but i\u2019m trying to teach her to love herself for who she is. i know that my words haven\u2019t gotten through to her, as she has been going to my sister for advice.\n\nfirst was the at home exercises and running. it is difficult to watch her beat herself up with these exercises. she claims to enjoy them, but i\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t do them if she didn\u2019t want to be skinny like my sister. then she started regularly complaining about the food that i prepare. i\u2019m not a huge vegetable person, and neither is anybody else in our family. i\u2019m not going to waste money on it. it has led to many arguments between us. \n\nthe final straw was when i opened up a package that turned out to be a food scale for my daughter. my sister bought it for her. my daughter told me that since i will continue to make her eat unhealthy food, her aunt told her to weigh it out so she doesn\u2019t eat too much. \n\ni immediately confronted my sister about it. she is trying to push her lifestyle habits onto my daughter. i\u2019m trying to teach her to love herself not spend mental energy fighting biology. she tried to blame me for making my daughter \u201cunhealthy\u201d in the first place, she claims to be trying to help. just because my daughter can\u2019t run a mile and do the difficult exercises she does to maintain her weight, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not healthy.\n\ni hung up with my sister and went to post to facebook about her buying my young daughter a scale and encouraging her to weigh her food. people look up to her, and i think everyone should know that she pushes young women to hate their bodies. my post received a lot of criticism and some people even think i\u2019m an asshole for trying to tarnish my sisters image and for refusing to let my daughter try to lose weight.\n\nfrom my perspective i\u2019m just trying to spread awareness about what she is doing. someone recommended that i post here, aita for telling everyone that my sister got my daughter a food scale, or is she for getting her one in the first place.\n\n\u2014\njust to respond to everyone, we are not obese we are just a bit taller and a bit chubby. maybe a little bit overweight. we may not run and stuff but we do other activities that we enjoy like gardening, swimming, walking, etc. you

she said alice is having it to spite her and her split (alice knew about the split). i told her that she could've picked a later date, when katie's feeling better but alice said that we were being unreasonable and she's sorry for katie, but this doesn't have anything to do with her. i said that maybe she didn't mean it directly, but it does seem like she's showing off and not being inclusive.

going to give you some context as to what she did and why i don't pity her. i (28f) have a sister, caitlin, who is one year older than me. growing up, we were dirt poor. our family nailed almost every single southern hillbilly stereotype on the head. we both did decently, but neither of us had ever considered college.\u00a0\n\n\ncaitlin graduated high school first and got a full time job immediately. she began to help with bills, but at some point began thinking about maybe going to school. i was having the same thoughts a year later when i graduated. well, what we hadn't known was that when our great-grandma died, she left my dad all that she had which came up to a sum of a couple thousand dollars that they decided to save for us. and because cait began talking about maybe going to school, mom began to save her bill money to add to the sum of the money. unfortunately, it still wasn't a lot, so our parents sat us down and explained that they had money for only one of us to go to school and that they would have to think about who to give it to.\u00a0\n\n\ni was prepared to fight for this chance, because i realized this was my chance to better myself. i was ready to do whatever it took, but i didn't end up needing to because cait gave up.\u00a0\n\n\ni guess caitlin realized she wouldn't be picked because i had better grades and was more well-liked because mom told me later that day that she had backed down and said to give it to me.\n\n\nso fast forward, i got my bsn and work as a travel nurse. i do very well for myself and live an 2hrs away from my hometown. i went to visit my sister because she's pregnant with my nephew and i missed her and brought some gifts. we had lunch and were just chatting about what we were up to when she began to complain and whine that she was tired and asked if i didn't mind if she vented. before i could answer, she started talking about how she was tired all of the time from her shifts at work and then having to come home to her kids and her husband. it sounded a lot like she was regretting her life and after about twenty minutes, it was starting to get on my nerves.\u00a0she would not stop or change topic. \n\n\nfinally, i lost it and told her that i wasn't here to listen to her complain and that she really shouldn't complain about the life she chose. i told caitlin that if she didn't have to get married or have a low paying job, and if she had wanted to better herself, she should've fought harder to go to college instead of giving up before she even tried. it ended in her crying, which i felt horrible about, and then she went home without saying anything else. i tried apologizing for how i phrased it, but not for anything i actually said because it was true, but she won't accept it. our parents have been giving me the cold shoulder and i feel lost because they won't listen to my side of why i said what i said. aita here??", "my sister got married last weekend.  i flew into town and my parents insisted

years at the end of the year. my cousin (30f) is also getting married a month after my wedding. due to our weddings being close together, my cousin and i have been bonding over it. a few weeks ago my cousin and i went out to lunch and afterwards we decided to go to a bridal store to browse the dresses. my cousin spotted a dress that she loved and i did too. i\u2019ve been having a tough time finding the perfect dress and this was the first dress i\u2019ve come across that i could genuinely imagine myself wearing. but my cousin seemed to really like it and so i started saying negative things about the dress and how she\u2019d suit a dress with straps instead of long sleeves etc. i succeeded in convincing her that the dress wasn\u2019t for her and a week later i went back to the store with my sister and best friends to try the dress on and well i ended up picking it as my wedding dress. i highly doubt that she will remember the dress by the time my wedding day comes around so i didn\u2019t expect any drama to occur.\n\ntwo days ago my cousin messaged me excitedly to tell me that she finally chose her wedding dress and well.. it\u2019s the exact same dress from the store that i chose. i had no choice but to tell her that i got that dress as well. she was confused because she thought i hated the dress so i told her the truth that i only lied because i wanted the dress

out she wasn\u2019t my biological daughter and my wife had cheated on me years ago with a friend. as it turns out this so called \u201cfriend\u201d was suddenly interested in playing dad. my wife and i divorced, my daughter learned the truth and i told her i still loved her no matter what. of course she was interested now in getting to know her biological father and while it hurt i tried to accept that. she started pulling away from me after that. even when trying to still do things together as a family she was no longer interested. the last straw was when she was 20 and living at my house. we were arguing because she\u2019d dropped from her college courses, hasn't done anything for 3 months  and mad because i told her she either needed to go to school or work if she wants to stay here for free. she told me i\u2019m not her real dad so stop pretending like i am and she\u2019ll just go stay with her real father. that broke me honestly. but i told her if that\u2019s how she really feels then there\u2019s really nothing left to say between us. and she did move out to go live with him. i was depressed for a very long time, drank so much. my son (24m) was my only reason to keep moving forward. for the first couple years i reached out to my daughter. she wanted no contact, i learned to accept that and move on. it helped me find more peace in my life. my son stopped talking to her for a while over this and was angry with her. \n\nthey still chat sometimes, which doesn\u2019t bother me at all. through him i learned her biological father died in october 2019. also that she\u2019s engaged. she reached out to me, first that she knows that \u201cwe haven\u2019t talked in a while\u201d but wants to ask me if i\u2019d be willing to walk her down the isle. after a pretty long message about how much she hurt me in the past with her actions, i told her no. she didn\u2019t want me to be her father anymore so i learned to no longer view her as my daughter. this turned into a fight between us because according to her it\u2019s not her fault she wanted to know her real dad. and i agreed with her it\u2019s not, but what was her fault was how she treated me ever since. \n\nin

she\u2019s ranting to my family that i\u2019m ruining her day and she thought parents are supposed to love their kids unconditionally. my brothers seem to think now that i am being an asshole and this is my chance to be in her life again. but i have no interest in that. \n\nstill seems everyone has a strong opinion on it that i\u2019m making it difficult for my daughter to have the wedding she

same interest, same views, same goals in life. the only issue we had was how we felt about each other's appearance. i don't need a woman who hides herself with make up, in fact i oppose that, but i do like my woman to have her hair managed and does dress up a little when we go on dates. now my then girlfriend wasn't like that - she had a masculine sense of fashion and let her frizzy hair wayward. after our talk we set some ground rules - we weren't going to change our appearances for one another, but there were factors we take into consideration; she liked a well trimmed beard and certain length hair cut so i made sure to maintain those things. i asked she put some effort into how she dressed on our date. i never said it had to be a dress, but just a nice blouse.\n\n8 months in of dating we almost broke up because while i fulfilled my end of the bargain, she never did. i explained i didn't want her to be uncomfortable and what i want shouldn't come before that, so it was best we split. she decided she loved me and put in more of an effort.\n\nwe get married, move in together and life gets rolling. but as it does she went back into her old ways of never dressing up or managing her hair. i still keep my beard trim the way she likes it, along with my hair cut. when i mentioned it to her she shrugs and says, 'we're married now, it doesn't matter'. to me it does.\n\nshe has 2 close friends - both wives and moms too. whenever i see them they're both dressed nicely and cleaned up. they invite my wife to get her hair trimmed with them or attend a yoga class

home and she didn't tell me that i couldn't take the whole tray.  she said it should have been obvious that i shouldn't take the whole thing since the tray was so big.  to be fair to her, it was a really big tray (my family of 5 only just finished the tray yesterday after eating it for dinner both nights) but i don't think the size of the tray makes it obvious that i shouldn't take it.\n\nmonday night and last night, my girlfriend complained that she had to eat instant noodles for dinner so that she wouldn't blow her food budget. today, she is asking me if i can buy her a sandwich since i took her leftovers for the week. it sucks that she spent her food budget on the lasagna but i think this is her fault for not being clear that i shouldn't take the whole thing. i don't think she is justified in asking me to buy her lunch because of it. she called me an asshole for not being willing to help her out. aita?", "my (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. she made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about \"sending it back\" if it was a boy. the jokes all seemed lighthearted and i just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. fast forward to our 20 week scan. we go in super excited and nervous. i don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. \n\nwe go in and find out we are having a boy. my wife immediately bursts into tears and i hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. she doesn't stop crying the whole day. i let her calm down and try to comfort her. \n\nit's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. she refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. \n\nnow that it's been nearly a month i'm starting to get a bit frustrated. it's just such an overreaction. i told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. she cried and called me an asshole. i told her she needs to get a grip. i felt awful but i feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous. \n\nmy wife and i made up but she's still acting the same and i'm getting upset again. \n\naita for being upset about this? i love the baby beyond words and am just upset she doesn't seem to anymore.", "i (23f) have been with my boyfriend (28m) for 4 years now. for context, these friends were friends with boyfriend for years before he met me. over the years they have become my friends as well as we\u2019re all part of the same circle now (about 14 people.) for obvious reasons, i\u2019m not as close with them as my spouse is. \n\nnow here\u2019s where it all starts. back in february 2019, my boyfriend and i decided to spend a weekend at disneyland. it was originally going to be just us 2, but he had asked if i would be okay if he invited some friends (about 6 of the 14 people, of this 6, 4 were guys and 2 were women and they were girlfriends of 2 of the guys.) these 4 guys are my boyfriend\u2019s closest friends in the group.  i agreed since i thought that it would be fun, but i was wrong.\n\nthey (referring to the 4 guys) didn\u2019t want to go on any rides, or see any of the shows. they only wanted to eat at the various disney restaurants.  to be frank, i don\u2019t care much for eating theme park food as tasty as it may be. the food is overpriced and i just don\u2019t feel comfortable eating so much fattening food. the other women in the group didn\u2019t care much for the food either, but they sat along while their partners ate. \n\nthis would have been fine if they let my boyfriend and i go off and enjoy ourselves, but they guilted him into not leaving them behind \u201cwe want to ride x ride together.\u201d i did not enjoy my disney weekend very much. fast forward to this past weekend, the original disney 6 were at our place. my boyfriend brought up that we\u2019re planning a little getaway near the end of summer. \n\none of the guys said he\u2019d love to join us and the others followed. before i could say \u201cactually it\u2019s just a couple getaway for the two of us\u201d my boyfriend said \u201csure! sounds great!.\u201d \ni paused, and then said to the group \u201cto be honest, i would prefer if you all didn\u2019t come.\u201d my boyfriend\u2019s closest friend asked why i didn\u2019t want them to come and i said \u201ci just think we have different holiday priorities. as evidenced by disney.\u201d \n\nhe then followed up with \u201coh you didn\u2019t have fun at disney?\u201d i said \u201cno, being gluttonous is not how i want to spend a vacation. it\u2019s okay if you do, but it\u2019s clear we\u2019re just not compatible to holiday anymore.\u201d the rest of the night was awkward and quiet. after they left, my boyfriend said i was being a diva and out of line.", "my (f30) and my husband (m32) have a toddler together (m4). our property has no fence. i was inside, my husband was sitting on the porch watching our son, and our son was playing on the lawn. all of a sudden, i heard my kid wailing and i rushed outside. he had fallen and scraped his knee. i saw my husband head over before me which makes sense because he was closer than i was, but when he squatted down to help, he fainted. the exact timing is unclear. i don\u2019t know if he squatted and then fainted or fainted mid-squat, i just know he was passed out on the grass by the time i got there. \n\nmy husband is squeamish, he doesn\u2019t like gore, and blood makes him uncomfortable. i knew this when we dated and i knew it when we married. he\u2019s fainted before (we dated in college and he faints at vomit as well) and he usually comes to shortly after. we\u2019ve been together 10 years and i\u2019ve seen him faint maybe three times including this instance. anyway, he passed out on the grass and my son was still screaming so i picked him up and carried him inside. when i was dressing his wound, my husband came in a couple minutes later angry that i left him unconscious and unattended on our lawn.\n\nwe don\u2019t live in a dangerous neighborhood, we\u2019re friends with our neighbors, he was dressed for the weather because he was sitting on the porch outside anyway, and we live in an area where the climate doesn\u2019t fluctuate too much so i didn\u2019t feel there was a risk of hypothermia/heat stroke. it was maybe 70 degrees and clear which is why we let our son play outside.\n\nit only takes a couple minutes to dress my son\u2019s wound and kiss it better so i would\u2019ve checked on my husband shortly after but my husband says i should never leave someone unconscious and unattended. i agree with his point generally, but if there\u2019s only two of us present and our son is hurt, i don\u2019t see what the big deal is. he thinks i should have left our son with him while i go inside to get the bandages and dress his wound on the lawn or take my son inside, get the bandages, and bring him back out to dress his wound on the lawn. i guess the last idea makes sense, but as a mom with a crying kid, i didn\u2019t think about it that deeply. aita?", "off the title alone you might be inclined to call me an asshole but hear me out.\n\ni'm 31m, she's 30f. we have a 2 year old son. my wife has never worked in her life, which is fine. she spent a lot of time studying in her youth and she has a great degree. she wanted to work after college but we had a child and she decided of her own accord to be a sahm. this is all fine to me, i make enough to support us all. not life changing money but comfortable money, $80k/yr or thereabouts.\n\nevery year around sept-oct, i get a nice bonus. always a lump sum, usually $4-8k. this year i received a $5,000 bonus. our finances are shared, of course. i don't mind. i live very frugally, the only thing i sometimes splurge on is music. i might spend $1,000/yr on guitar or keyboard gear and i always refer to my wife first.\n\nthat is until i broached the idea of a new guitar. it's just about $5,000 after taxes and etc. this is literally my only hobby that costs money. i might spend only $2,000/yr on personal leisure, so while this new guitar is a big purchase, it's really the only thing i can entertain myself with. she said this is too big of a purchase and gave me an emphatic \"no\". it's not even a thing of \"we can use it on xyz instead\", it's \"you can't buy things that cost this much\".\n\nbut i did it anyways. it's my money, especially since it's a performance based bonus. and i don't regret it, this is probably the best thing i've ever bought for myself. i felt like a 10 year old on christmas day, a feeling i seldom get.\n\ni know you shouldn't spend money without spouse approval for something this big, but i disagreed with her reasoning that $5,000 is just too much to spend on something. it doesn't hurt us financially, so why not? aita?\n\nedit for more info: without going too much into our financial situation, $5,000 is almost nothing. we have $15,000 in a college fund already (we live in canada so tuition is already subsidized and cheap otherwise) and our savings is $40,000. of my income, i'd say about 20% goes into savings or work into the house (renos, etc), &lt;5% for my leisure, around 5%

we got a divorce 5 years ago due to infidelity on his part. i was devastated. he was the love of my life and he betrayed all of the trust and loyalty we had built up. to make matters worse, he ended up in a relationship with the woman he cheated on me with. they got engaged one year later and are set to be married in two weeks. honestly, i still am heartbroken over my divorce. it\u2019s hurtful to me that we were together for 20 years, and he could just go fall in love with someone else, as if i was nothing. however, joceline was only 9 when we divorced, and he\u2019s a great father so i would never want to come in between their bond. joceline loves his fianc\u00e9e as she\u2019s very sweet to her, but she doesn\u2019t know the reason why her dad and i divorced, i want to tell her when she\u2019s a bit older and he doesn\u2019t want to tell her at all. anyways, i compromised with him that joceline could come to the wedding, but that he would have to provide the transportation to and from the wedding, as i want no part of it. i don\u2019t want to drop my daughter off at his wedding, i don\u2019t want to see all the decorations and the happy guests, it\u2019d just be too much for me. i didn\u2019t tell him all of that obviously, but he agreed.\n\ntoday he calls me and asks if he can ask for a huge favor. it turns out that his future in laws are flying in the morning of the wedding, and he has to go pick them up, therefore he can\u2019t pick up my daughter the day of and wanted to ask if i could take her. i said absolutely not and asked why he can\u2019t pick her up the day before when she gets off of school. he said he doesn\u2019t want to make the drive twice, and that he will likely not have time as he has to prepare for the rehearsal dinner. i asked why can\u2019t the bride pick up her parents, he said she\u2019ll be getting her hair done and won\u2019t be able to. i laughed and told him there was no way i\u2019d take my daughter, and that he\u2019d have to figure it out.\n\nboy why did i say that. my daughter ran downstairs crying, face beet red 10 minutes after my conversation with her dad, calling me terrible and accusing me of not wanting her to spend time with her dad. i told her that\u2019s not the case and she demanded to know why i couldn\u2019t take her, i couldn\u2019t give her an answer and she ran upstairs crying. now i\u2019m

knocking. i do generally lock my room, but it\u2019s never been a big deal because my roommate never comes in w/o knocking. also, i did not know this girl was in the house. i\u2019d have made sure to lock the door then. obviously she went like wtf and ran out. \n\nthen she was very cross with me, and seemed to think that i owed her an apology because she saw me naked and it made her very uncomfortable. i was nope, you walked into my room w/o knocking, what you see or didn\u2019t see after that is not my fault. at all. her explanation was that the other bathroom was busy and she just wanted to use the one in my bedroom. \n\nshe\u2019s involved roommate into this and he too thinks that i should apologise because i shouldn\u2019t have been walking around in my room naked without

sunday would work and marie said yes but mike said no unless it was later in the evening since he has to work. i was over trying to beg for a bit of family time so i just texted both of them and said i'd leave their presents on their porches since there's no time for our family anyway and it seems to them that our family doesn't matter, only their spouses families. they both tried calling and texting me but i ignored them.\n\nlater on my husband convinced me to do sunday after 3. i told the kids this but said that since they don't care about our family anymore this will be the last family

enough to not join the hoa. as a result, i am able to make extensions and i have a pool, which i host neighborhood parties occasionally. my hoa is one of the worst hoas, constantly fining people hundreds of dollars for parking violations, painting their fences the wrong shades of brown, wrong  color curtains, having 2 flags etc. they're not the worst hoa but they're bad. we also got a shitty neighbor, jessica, who likes to go around and snap photos of people's violations and then post it on the next-door app to shame them. she prides herself in this thinking it makes the neighborhood better when she shames the smiths for having a fence thats 2 inches too high, or the johnsons for having light brown door instead of a dark brown door. jessica is a fucking cunt, she's probably cost neighbors thousands of dollars in fees or forcing them to renovate. i absolutely lost my shit when jessica posted in the next door app about how mrs jenson (85 year old woman, currently having serious medical issues) has a lawn thats a couple inches too high. she obviously can't mow the lawn and was too busy to notice. the hoa then fined her 500 dollars.\n\ni made a post in the next-door app about the next-door app saying that the suburban fascists on the hoa nor jessica were invited to my bbq at my house. jessica went on a ran saying how much of a angel she is and how she protects the neighborhood doing her duty and i told her she's a low life scumbag busybody and is a pathetic loser with nothing better to do. a couple people said i was bullying and excluding her and like 4 of her

trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. i\u2019ve never objected to people crossing our land as i\u2019m an avid hiker and don\u2019t want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.\n\nanyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. it\u2019s basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. so she\u2019ll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it\u2019s a multi day hike). \n\nit made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.\n\nnow, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. it \u201cfeels like\u201d 40-45 degrees celsius during june-july. today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. they said they were out of water and asked if i could refill their water bottles. i told them i could for 50cents a bottle. the reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). we aren\u2019t connected to an endless supply of water.\n\nthey were furious that i refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. i told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (i\u2019ve drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted i top them up. \n\nthey had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. so i refilled the young girl\u2019s bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. they refused and very angrily went on their way. my wife says i should have filled them up, but imo so long as the little girl is okay i don\u2019t think they deserved anything given their attitude.", "i (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. we met on instagram, i followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. i thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. she makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. \n\nhowever, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. she has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like \"she's dirty\", \"kids are all feral\" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. \n\nrecently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. as soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. \n\nthis really annoyed me, i get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. if she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. she just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. i just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. \n\nalso at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.\n\non the way home, i told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of \"kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is\". i told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks i'm an asshole. ", "ok, so, throwaway account cause this is a bit embarrassing. i (f19) share a room with my younger sister (f18). because the room is relatively small, we share a bunkbed. we're pretty used to this arrangement, as we've had it since we were 13 and 14 respectively, and had an arrangement where we would swap the top bunk between us every month. \n\nthe issue is, since we were 13 and 14, both of us have gained a lot of weight, so getting into the top bunk is...difficult. it's especially difficult for me, as i'm considerably  heavier, to the point where i physically can't make it onto the top bunk without exhausting myself totally, and climbing down is a pretty harrowing experience. as a result, i told my sister that i wanted the bottom bunk indefinitely until i can get my weight back down to a level i can climb up there without worrying i'm going to break it or myself. obviously, losing weight can be quite a long slow process, especially when previously you've had alifestyle as unhealthy as mine, but this has been a real wake-up-call for me. she said it's not a fair arrangement because she struggles climbing up as well, but it's totally not the same- she's slimmer than me, more physically fit, and i think a fair bit stronger. i don't doubt it's difficult but i've never seen her as totally winded as i am after climbing up, or heard the bed creak like it does with me on it. i said it's non-negotiable, and i'm not sleeping in the top bunk until i've lost around 30lbs. she's called me selfish and unsympathetic, and it's my fault for getting so out of shape.  we haven't spoken, aside from in really stilted terms, since we first had that conversation \n\ni know it's petty but aita?  on one hand i hate putting her in difficult situation, but on the other hand i don't think it's as dangerous for her as it is for me, and i really don't think i fit on the couch. \n\nalso, it's really difficult talking about my weight in difficult terms, so please stow your comments about that. i know it's unhealthy, i know i shouldn't have let it get to this point, but i'm trying to work on it and i don't need reddit to tell me what i already know.", "i'm 19f and live at home

they're doing most of the time. the boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their parents are hella weird. they have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. my mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like \"i saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago\" \"they were in our garden 5 minutes ago i think now they're headed to the skate park\". i think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.\n\none of the moms in the chat is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'jake' is there. we once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.\n \nnow yesterday i was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. jakes mom had called my phone two times but i didn't answer cause she was annoying me. my boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. we were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. it was all nice and peaceful and suddenly i hear a really loud knock. it really made us jump because it was just so sudden. i turn to look and there's jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. i nearly hit the ceiling i was so angry. i go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt i just wanted to ask because i haven't seen jake in almost two hours ect.ect. apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. i really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. i also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.\n\nmy boyfriend thought i was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other parents are now blowing up her phone. she also thinks i shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  i feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but i feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.", "i

is apparently on a diet  and didn't want to go somewhere where she could get a salad.\n\nit didn't really bother me that they disagreed with my choice, but what bothered me was that they hadn't even tried the food or looked at the menu, but already didn't want to go. they asked me to change my choice and instead that we could go to a nearby restaurant that they go to every week and that i don't really like. i refused and said they just didn't have to come.\n\nonly my uncle came with me when we went to the restaurant yesterday, which i'm happy about because i know the rest of the family would have done nothing but complain. it was delicious and it was nice eating with an actually adventurous person for once. \n\nnow the rest of the family is angry at us because birthday meals usually

unfortunately they broke up almost three years ago. my son recently started dating a guy i don\u2019t even know, he\u2019s 13 years younger than my son. as far as i know he has a job, but he\u2019s too young for my son. it's not that i don't like the guy, it's that i feel that he and my son are not compatible. my son is well educated, he\u2019s successful and i don\u2019t want this guy to take advantage of him. meanwhile this guy has a normal job, is ridiculous and impolite. this boy has no class, he\u2019s ridiculous and inappropriate. i don't like the youthful way in which he dresses, the mannerisms of him, i consider it rude. i know that many mothers can relate to my situation. it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s not compatible with my son. \n\nmy son brought his boyfriend to thanksgiving because i invited them, after dinner my son\u2019s boyfriend asked me if i wanted help. i told him that i didn\u2019t need any help but he did it anyway. my daughter-in-law is pregnant, she and i were talking about when she receives the baby and how there will be a new member in the family, to which she replied \u201cwe actually have two new members of the family\u201d referring to my son's boyfriend. so i told her that we really only have a new member because my son's boyfriend is not part of the family yet. what i was referring to is that in reality this boy is not part of the family because he has not married my son yet. my son called me complaining about having spoken to his boyfriend like that, called me a classist and asked me to apologize. i was just being logical, they\u2019re not married. he will be part of the family if he gets to marry my son\u2026 aita for being logical?", "when my daughter was young, we introduced her to gymnastics.  she was totally hooked and kept asking for more and more lessons. we encouraged her, thinking she will eventually lose interest. now she is 12, training 20 hours a week, spending weekends after weekends competing at high level competitions.\n\nproblem is, she is 5'7 already and still growing. she is starting to have ambition for d1 scholarship, or even olympics. that makes me very worried. being 5'7 basically kills her chance of going to the olympics. d1 gymnastics scholarship is already rare, the odds of her getting one with her height is even more rare.\n\nit makes me feel bad that our daughter is very, very dedicated. she's almost always the first one at the gym and the last one to leave. she watches replays of her routine on our drive to training, turns down social events because she \"needs to train\", does extra conditioning at home.\n\nyet i cannot justify blowing thousands of dollars a year and hundreds of hours in time every year to gamble on something with so little chance of success. all the hours spent at her training, driving her to competition is already causing our family life to suffer.  she under-rotates her skills because of her height, and gets injured more frequently than others.  her academics are suffering because of her gymnastics commitment.  her life is going in the wrong direction because of gymnastics.  the bandaid is better ripped off earlier than later.  my husband agrees.\n\ni broke the news to my daughter. frankly, it breaks my heart to tell her to give up something she has worked so hard for. i told her i know she is a hard worker. she would get much better reward if she channels her hard work elsewhere, like in school, or another sport. hell, she plays tennis with the family only casually, yet she was able to win a few u12 tournaments locally. if that's not talent, i don't know what is!\n\nneedless to say, she did not take that well. she cried and cried and cried, locking herself in her room, refusing to eat, saying maybe if she doesn't eat, she will become shorter. i told her over and over that i love her, and i just want the best for her, but she wouldn't have any of it. i tried to reason with her - telling her chasing a \"dream\" is a privilege, not a right.  no use!  my husband has now softened even though we used to have an agreement. our family is now phoning us to try to persuade us to let her continue training, even offering support for training cost and pickup / drop-offs.\n\nif she has the right body type to be an elite gymnast, or if she is tall like she is, but is not struggling because of her height, i would support her unconditionally. however that is not the case! sometimes i feel like giving in, but to think it through, i was the person who drove her to training and competition, i am the breadwinner who paid for her training.  it should be my right to call it off, especially as a parent.\n\nhelp me out reddit. am i the wrongs???", "i paid $10,000 (pa) for this room, and am paying much more than market rate because i am a student with no guarantor who needs to live near my college.  \n\n\nmy mattress was horrible, it stank and was very very flat, but i know from friends that the college does not care. so the day i moved in i poured some food coloring mixed to fake some urine stains, and had my mattress replaced in 24 hours. tldr my college is ripping me off on accomodation so i faked a stain for a budget mattress replacement.", "i(20f) have a younger brother(17m) who's a student. his school starts at 8am but he wants to get there by 7.30, preferably even sooner because she likes to hang out with his friends in front of the school before school starts.\n\nbecause of 'rona my parents don't want my brother to take the packed bus to school so they drive him themselves. since my brother also wants to arrive at school extremely early my parents also have wake up way earlier so my brother can get his way. my parents and my brother usually leave the house at 7.10am so my brother can arrive to school when he wants to.\n\nat some point my parents got fed up and refused to wake up earlier so my brother can meet his friends before school. my brother got really pissed. then my brother got a girlfriend. sometimes my parents take a detour to also pick the girlfriend up but that results in them arriving at school only about ten minutes before school starts. because of the detour they also have to leave the house at 7.10am like they usually would if my brother got his way. since my parents like my brother's girlfriend they do her this favour.\n\nmy brother's girlfriend doesn't always have to be at school by 8am, sometimes she can get there later because of her schedule. if she has to be at school later than my brother we obviously don't give her a ride.\n\nnow, for the past couple of weeks my brother started lying to my parents so he can get to school earlier. he basically says that they also have to pick up his girlfriend and halfway to school he says that they actually don't have to pick her up. then my parents arrive at school at 7.30am, just like my brother wants to so he can meet his friends.\n\nfor the past week i have been driving my brother to school because of my parents' work schedules. we also picked his girlfriend up a couple times but yesterday my brother pulled what he had been pulling with my parents for over a month now. halfway through our ride to school he said we don't actually have to pick up his girlfriend.\n\ni got pissed and pulled into the next supermarket parking lot, where my brother started yelling at me. i just sat there playing on my phone for 15 minutes, then i drove him to school and dropped him off ten minutes before school starts.\n\nwhen my brother got home from school he started to complain about me and insult me to my parents. my mom says what i did was just what my brother needed but my dad says i overreacted, so now i'm unsure.\n\nso was i overreacting? aita for pulling into the parking lot and wait for 15 minutes after my brother lied to me?", "i (54) and my husband, \u201crick\u201d (57m) have 3 kids. the oldest  \u201ckurt\u201d (29m) is married to \u201cbecky\u201d (28f). she is normally a good dil and i try to be a good mil. we have had a pretty good relationship through the years. issues have only popped up in the last few months since they are now expecting a baby in november. it is relevant to this situation that kurt is technically my stepson but i am the only mother he has known.\n\nbecky is becoming increasingly difficult. she expects everyone to bend to her will \u201cbecause she is pregnant\u201d or \u201cbecause she is the mother of our grandchild.\u201d recently, rick &amp; kurt were talking about our finances and becky started making suggestions about what money we should start saving for our grandbaby. that same day, i served lunch. i made chicken for becky because she isn\u2019t eating cold cuts. she made a few comments about the cold cuts that she didn\u2019t have to eat. she also made a few comments about the wine we served. she does not want kurt drinking while she is pregnant but he didn't agree to this.\n\nmy husband and i have a second home that we just redid (knocked down the original). the new home has 3 floors (1st-bedrooms/hangout space, 2nd-middle living &amp; master, 3rd- bedrooms)this had been in the works for years so our kids are very excited to all go this summer. we are all set to go for our first trip in july.  \n\nthe issue that came up is that my 2 other kids, \u201ctim\u201d &amp; \u201ccassie\u201d(23m, 21f)  plan to have fun on this trip which includes having some friends to the house a few times, amusement park, scuba diving, going out. when becky and kurt were over last weekend, t&amp;c were talking about their plans and becky got upset saying that because she is pregnant, this trip shouldn\u2019t be all about drinking (it's not) but we aren't banning alcohol from the house. she also said that next year\u2019s trip will not include any get-togethers because she will have a small child. tim just told her not to worry because she doesn't have to participate in any of the fun.  \n\nbecky called me and said that she was upset about the plans. she said we needed to respect the fact she can\u2019t participate in all of the activities we are planning. i told her that there were plenty of things she can participate in and not worry about what the other kids were doing. she then said she really thinks i should limit the drinking and \u201cparties.\u201d i informed her that i have no intention of limiting anything since this is their vacation as well and these activities can take place on the back deck. i told her she can have the bedroom upstairs in the front so that she will not be bothered but she was mad she would have to walk up all the steps. she also accused me of caring less bc  kurt is not my son (not true).\n\nat the end of our talk, i told her could get a rental to have their own space but she accused me of trying to exclude her.  i reminded her she spent many nights out drinking when she was their age and that the world can't revolve around her just because she is pregnant aita?", "about a week ago, my (39f) family ordered chinese food for delivery. when the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16f) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. my son (13m)  loudly says, \u201cmake sure the hide the cat from the chinese guy!\u201d as i am at the door getting the food from the chinese delivery driver. he very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. i quickly apologized and took the food. \n\ni told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. so, later that night i forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. then the next day i took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. the driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. he then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver. \n\nthat night my husband (43m) and i got into an argument about me making our son do this. he told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the \u201cpunishment didn\u2019t fit the crime\u201d. i told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. i do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. my husband told me that it was \u201cjust a joke\u201d and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. i feel like i might have over reacted some but i think it\u2019s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.", "my brother in-law (sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. he moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (olivia &amp; sloane18) with him a couple of months ago.\nhis sister (my wife) and i have one daughter (zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\n\nolivia &amp; sloane have no respect for zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. zoey complained a lot and i've already asked the girls to respect zoey's privacy and stop taking things. my wife and sammy saw no issue with this. after all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. i completely disagreed. \n\nlast straw was when zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. don't know much about makeup but that's what zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying.\ni told my wife and she said she'd ask sloane to apologize but i got zoey a lock after i found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\n\nsammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.\nsammy asked about it and i straight up told him. he said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is.\nhe accused me of being overprotective and babying zoey with this level of enablement.\n\ni told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying i was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded i remove it but i said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\n\nshe got mad i was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so i reminded her that i let sammy and his family move in which's something her own family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\n\neveryone's been giving me and zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.", "i (17f) was babysitting for a neighbour (jane) tonight. she had heard of me through a friend of hers (kate) who is someone i babysit for regularly - so when kate asked me to babysit for jane and gave glowing recommendations of how lovely jane was to me (i'm quite shy) and how good i was to jane - i thought \"sure. i enjoy babysitting, love kids, etc - why not?\" my mother took me over to jane's house, introduced herself, gave jane her number and left once she saw that there were actually kids there, that jane and her husband peter were getting ready to leave, that it was legit basically. \n\njane and peter left and i babysit the kids who were cool kids. i watch a movie, clean up the mess we had made in the kitchen (spaghetti with toddlers is a nightmare!) and chill on my phone. nothing i do on my phone while i am at jane's is anything near 'inappropriate'. i do have a lockable folder with some inappropriate things on there (aka anime and manga that are definitely not g rated) but don't touch that folder at all while i'm there. \n\njane comes home at 10pm, checks on the kids, checks out the house and as i'm waiting to be paid, she turns to me and says \"before i pay you - i need to look at your phone. i want to make sure that you didn't take photos of my house or my kids or look at anything rude\". i ask her whether she means she wants to look at my iphone's camera roll and she shakes her head. \"no, i want to quickly check your facebook, your messages and whatever other apps you have to double check\". \n\ni obviously say 'no' and jane tells me that she will not be paying me. i call my mother and she quickly comes down. she looks at my phone herself, tells jane there is nothing on there concerning her and to pay me now please. jane pays me and informs me i will not be asked back and that she will be telling kate that i was \"not a good babysitter!\". my mother replies that she will be also talking to kate about her choice of 'good friends' and we leave. \n\nmy reason for the post is that jane made a post on our neighbourhood community page on facebook talking about bad babysitters who couldn't accept the parents 'rules' they had for babysitting and still demanded to be paid - and was offering to \"pm\" people more details. someone else screenshotted their conversation where, although she didn't name me, she named the exact situation and jane got over 100 comments talking about how that was her right as a parent/homeowner/what not to check that her children were not harmed while left with a babysitter and the fact that i refused means i \"obviously\" did something wrong. aita?", "my younger sister

absolutely over the moon.\n\ni asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. \ni suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.\n\ni explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. \n\nshe told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.\n \nat this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told

"so i (26f) am expecting my first daughter with my husband (29m) in september. i grew up in a moderately religious household with pretty strictly defined gender roles. as in, since i was a girl, i had chores around the house while my younger brother did not have to do anything. \n\ni don't talk to my parents for a variety of reasons (going on year 5 now) so they do not know i am pregnant. both my aunts and grandparents were very supportive of me leaving my household and as such have been my main family. being 6 months pregnant now, people have started to give gifts and i am very grateful for them. \n\nwe have decided that we don't want our daughter to be surrounded by pink everything with only girl things. so we have made a conscious effort to include traditionally 'boy' outfits and toys like dinosaurs and cars. we have told people that any gender items would be accepted and if it's getting too much 'pink' we have gone out to balance a bit (getting a green jacket or something). my younger aunt  has taken great offense to this because 'boys are boys and girls are girls'. and she is a very verbal and loud person and has let us know several times her opinions. she has two boys. \n\n at my baby shower my older aunt gifted us a book called 'goodnight construction site' and a little stuffed truck. my younger aunt went on a tirade about how we are somehow making our daughter trans and not allowing her to be a girl. and she's a loud person so of course her saying this was more like a yell, and in front of my very liberal in-laws who are very supportive of our choice. \n\npregnancy hormones took over and i grabbed the toy, gave it to my younger aunt and asked her what part of the penis was needed to operate this toy truck. she yelled that's not what she meant and left. the rest of the baby shower went fine but it was a bit awkward after. since then she has been blowing up facebook where a bunch of people agree with her that i am making my daughter trans and have been telling me that i was an asshole. the rest of my think what we are doing is fine, but that i shouldn't have handled it that way. \n\nso was i an asshole?", "a week ago i went out with

car, fell asleep in a puddle when it was raining like crazy. i had to drag him inside. i leave him there and he\u2019s twitching his head and can barely move. he was dead weight. i went into another room and he peed himself. \n\nthe next day john was extremely embarrassed. he said he was sorry he was a burden and thankful i took care of him. he made me take $50 to buy cleaning supplies and bought me breakfast then uber to his car. he cleaned up too. \n\ni didn\u2019t see him since until a friend had a dinner party. at the dinner party i kept saying \u201cjohn had an uh-oh the other day, john why don\u2019t you tell everyone\u201d then he kept saying no and this isn\u2019t respectful of his boundaries to keep pushing if he said no. then i showed everyone a video of john twitching and

retailer where she wanted to make a baby registry. by this point i was extremely tired and wanted to go home. i had told my sister this and she promised this would be the last store. \n\ni must have

ridiculous. \n\nmy sister began to cry saying that i was shaming her for not being able to get pregnant and that i was making fun of her. i tried to defend myself and tell her that is not what i meant. she wouldn\u2019t listen and ran out of the store. everyone in the store was staring at us. they were looking at me like i was a complete monster after hearing what my sister said. \n\nmy

they\u2019d try and see each other anyway despite the stay at home orders. i\u2019ve been treating it as close to a regular roommate situation as i can, although he is my son so it\u2019s not quite the same, but my house is big enough that they can keep to themselves without bothering me.\n\nand not that i\u2019ve been trying to listen to their conversations, but from what i\u2019ve heard

only a 45 minute drive to her home town. they berated me over the phone a few times and then finally gave in and let her stay. \n\napparently she let it slip over video chat that they\u2019ve been sleeping in the same room(i don\u2019t really know what her parents expected when she moved in with him... but ok) and they called me again and demanded i separate them. i told them that again if she wants to leave i\u2019m not keeping her, she has the means to go home, it\u2019s not like i\u2019ve locked them in the same room. and there\u2019s a third spare bedroom that she can stay in if she decides she for some reason does want to be separated. \n\nthey said that i know what they\u2019re doing in there and that it\u2019s a tragedy that i\u2019m endorsing it. from my point of view is they\u2019re both the same age, technically adults, they can serve in the military, i\u2019m sure whatever they do in there they were doing at college. they\u2019re old enough to decide for themselves

confused at the mention of this name. he then faked a laugh and said \"nana who?\" i said \"nana your goddamn business what i\u2019m wearing! ok!\". he got upset and quickly left the table. my sils laughed but my husband and his parents were upset and later said that i was way out of line for bringing up nana to my bil knowing how heartbroken and depressed he is because of her. his mom said that

and i knew each other since we were little. we were next-door neighbors and always played together. we even went to the same kindergarten, primary school and middle/high school together.\n\none day during our sophomore year, we started talking about how most of our classmates had started dating. we obviously weren\u2019t okay with that and decided get one up on all of them by getting married. as a joke i made her a fake ring and she gave me her scrunchie.\n\na few weeks later, a drunk driver hit her. she sustained multiple injuries and was in the icu for 2 months, the doctor told her family that her survival chances are slim. in the only time i talked to her before she died, she made me promise to always visit her on our \"wedding anniversary\" and to wear her scrunchie during the visit.\n\n4 years ago when i started dating my girlfriend i told her about it and asked if she was okay with it. she commented about how sweet and nice the tradition was and told me she was perfectly fine with it.\n\ntoday was the 10th anniversary and i took the day off, before my girlfriend went to work she told me it\u2019s time to put this tradition to rest and move on because it was starting to get pathetic that i still wear a dead girl scrunchie to celebrate a fake marriage that we had 10 years ago.\n\ni was furious at her comments because she wasn\u2019t just a \u201cdead girl\u201d. she was my best friend and like a sister to me, we grew up and did everything together. i told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. it\u2019s not like i talk about her or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. the only times i've talked about her to my girlfriend is when i told her if she was okay with the tradition or if she asked me about her.\n\nwhen i told her that i'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it made her uncomfortable, she left for work angry at me and hasn't came

alone. after a lot of arguing and others getting involved. i stood my ground and they agreed to not bring kids.\n\nat the wedding no one brought kids. my parents and aunts were already there. but then i saw my 2 sisters arriving with their kids. i immediately went to ask what's the deal. they began arguing with me when i said i won't be letting them in with the kids. i saw my older sister came with her kids in the car i was pissed i asked why they decided to go against the rule and bring kids. my mom started yelling at me when i told my sisters they weren't allowed in with the kids. everyone was yelling at me i had to get the security involved to make them leave. my parents and aunt left shortly after.\n\nthey were so pissed at me. i got nasty texts later and my cousin posted about my \"shitty wedding\" on fb.\n\ndays later. i've gathered the family and explained that what they did was wrong. i asked if i allowed my sisters with their kids what message does that send to my inlaws and friends who wanted to bring kids but they couldn't? my sisters argued with me and it turned out my mom told them to bring their kids and she'd deal with me later. i told them they could've arranged for a babysitter but my mom said they wanted to celebrate as a whole family. said that i ruined my own wedding by making a scene. and everyone will always remember my wedding as a disaster, a shitshow because of mine and my wife's child-free bull. they said the only way to fix it is to have another wedding/party and include everyone especially kids- i called them unreasonable. i asked mom where tf she got the nerve to even demand that?. they blamed my wife and claimed it was deliberate.\n\ni left. they started talking to my wife trying to convince her that they don't approve of what

he likes pulling pranks on everyone in the house...and that included the house keeper. he did stuff like throw her purse, hide her wallet and got punished for  it then told to not do it again because our house keeper almost quit and we didn't wanr that.\n\n\nnow onto the current situation...sone days ago i got a call from jeremy while he was having friends over telling me he saw the house keeper sneak one of my jewelry into her purse and asked me to come home immediately. i freaked out and tried to call my husband but he didn't pick. i went home and was mad, i talked to the house keeper and she denied putting anything in her purse, i demanded to see her purse and my jewelry was there. the house keeper started swearing on her children that she didn't put it in there and had no idea how it got there....i believed her and figured jeremy had something to do with it given his history. i switched my attention towards him and had him explain to me exactly how he saw our house keeper do it. he told me what he saw but a friend of his came forward and said that he saw jeremy put the jewelry inside the lady's purse and was trying to get her in trouble. jeremy yelled at his friend then told me it was just one of his pranks but i was furious, i kicked the rest of his friends who covered for him out and i punished him hard and apologized to the house keeper.\n\nmy husband reacted unexpectly after he heard and said that i was wrong for choosing to believe the house keeper over our son even though there was a witness but he said his friend must've said this to get him in trouble or because the house keeper paid him to side woth her which was shockingly absurd of him to say. he said i was not being a good mother and my first instinct is to always believe my son in whatever he says amd never ever question him infront of his friends like that.\n\ni'm confused, did i mess up?", "i had an incident on the train last week and it's been bothering me since it happened. i'm wondering whether or not i was the asshole. my family are split and the whole situation was upsetting and left me pretty shaken.\n\ni was traveling down to visit my uncle for new year who has been struggling with cancer and couldn't spend time with the whole family during christmas. i had to take the train with my two kids (ages 4 and 7) and it was a pretty last minute booking as we weren't sure if me and the kids were going to be able to go.\n\nit was about a 7 hour trip all around with about 4 of that on the train, and my kids were really tired and everything was a bit overwhelming so i didn't see a problem with sitting in the seats marked as reserved whilst the train was still pretty empty.\n\nthe journey was quiet. we got to have a bit of rest and have a few drinks and some food which the kids appreciated since it was such a long day for them. when people came on looking for their seats i stayed quiet and hoped their seats weren't ours. a man walked up and down the train a few times before starting to ask people if they could move (so he could see the numbers on the headrests), which i thought was pretty rude when he could easily have just sat in another seat for now (the train wasn't that full)\n\nanyway it turned out that my daughter was sitting in the seat this guy had reserved and when he aggressively said to her that she was in his seat she kind of looked a bit startled and looked to me. i had been watching this guy be rude to other passengers and i was pretty angry that he'd speak to my daughter the same way, rather than look to me and ask politely. she's seven and is obviously with me. i told her to stay where she was as there weren't any other seats she could move to that were next to me and suggested he sit somewhere else as there were more than a few seats dotted around.\n\nhe goes off muttering and i assumed he was going to sit down but he came back a few minutes later with a member of staff and was shouting at this point how we had stolen his seats that he'd paid money for and we weren't even supposed to be on the train. the woman checked our tickets and i explained to her that we were just tired and didn't think it would have been a problem to sit in the seats whilst the train wasn't full. to his fury the woman told us not to worry and also suggested that he sit elsewhere.\n\nhe started shouting about how we had stolen his seat and children weren't above the law. long story short he was told that he needed to get off the train at the next stop as he wasn't welcome on the service. at this point both of my kids were pretty shaken and i regretted the whole journey but wasn't sure what i could even do at this point.\n\nwas i the asshole here for creating this situation, part of me thinks this man was just crazy and

at rest. a little while later though the husband began asking if he could dogsit sometime bring onyx to their place for a sleepover. i said no and explained again that onyx is a service dog and i needed him to ya know...... stay alive. her husband got an attitude and told me onyx wasn't a machine and i had no right to deprive him of fun. then he pulled the i'm a man so i know more than you card by explaining that i was wrong and he was right and i could go one night without onyx and control my seizures. all this time my friend sat on the couch saying nothing. \n\ni asked him to leave and after some huffing and puffing about how rude i am and what happened to manners and onyx would've had fun they both did.\n\nnow today my friend called asking if they could stop by. i explained that i would love to have her over but her husband was no longer welcome. she got upset and told me that he was just like that and it was hard to tell sometimes because he had never seen me have a full blown seizure. i got kinda mad and sarcastically asked her if i should purposely cause a seizure so her husband was comfortable. she just kept repeating that he meant no harm and wanted onyx to have fun. i just told her again that she is welcome but he is not.\n\naita. i feel awful and feel like i'm creating an issue but that man is just toxic energy and i worry that his disbelief of my need

some of the teachers. so imagine my surprise when i found out that my brother started dating him. yeah, he hasn't kept it a secret that he's bi and that he experimented with guys before, but i seriously didn't expect that my brother of all people to be his type. i seriously thought they were gonna break up pretty fast, as david doesn't seem like the type to settle down easily, but

like he's the best thing since sliced bread, not to mention how he's following him like a puppy whenever they go together to an event. \n\nyesterday was my brother's birthday and he once again kept praising david, this time about his cooking skills. apparently he made him a special dinner and birthday cake, which i said that seemed cheap and it's kinda worrying that his own boyfriend doesn't

effort to make his birthday truly special, which really made him hopeful about their future together. i, however, wasn't impressed and told my brother that he should hold his horses and that david isn't the type to settle down and he's probably just an \"experiment\" to him. my brother asked me what the hell i was talking about and i told him about how he used to sleep with pretty much everyone in college before they started dating and that there are even rumors about him sleeping with teachers just to keep his grades high. and considering that his grades haven't lowered since they started dating, i would be on guard around him if i was in his place. my brother went silent and pretty much stopped talking with me for the rest of the day, but at night i got a message from david telling me to stop spreading \"fake\" rumors about him and to stop trying to sabotage his relationship with my brother. however, i don't really think i was doing any of that, all i did was just warn my brother

brother ?", "i have 2 kids, 'clark' and 'kent'. while they have the same father, only one of them is biologically my child. they were born within 6 months of each other. the boys are currently 6, and for various reasons i have full custody of both of them.\n\ni didn't speak to anyone in my family for several years, and we got back in touch in 2019. due to the boys' ages, my family know i couldn't have carried both, unless i have the gestation period of a hamster or the longest labour ever. i have explained to them how this all came to be, but in my explanation i neglected to tell them which was my biological child.\n\ndue to my ex having a type, the other woman looked enough like me that the boys could pass for twins. same dark hair, blue eyes, pale skin, and both cleft chins and dimples. my brother jokes that they look like tiny supermen. people who know them refer to them as twins because aside from a few minor differences, they're practically identical. frankly, if they were closer in age and i'd had full custody of both from the time they were born, i suspect i would have mixed them up a lot as babies.\n\nshortly before clark's birthday last year, my mum asked if she could see clark's birth certificate. i asked why and she said she wanted to know the exact time he was born, so i told her. she asked if she could see the certificate anyway. i asked why. she said she just wanted to check. i said i'm his mother, i know when he was born. then she asked the same thing about kent and we went through the same conversation all over again. mum eventually admitted that she just wanted to see the birth mother's name on each certificate, which isn't even how that works and i told her as much.\n\nthis led to an argument where my stance was that i'm their mother, biology is irrelevant. mum says if biology is irrelevant then it's not a big deal to tell her which of them is biologically mine. i said if she's so hung up on biology, then clearly it's a big deal to her and i don't want it to be a big deal, especially as the boys themselves don't know.\n\nmum feels this is incredibly selfish, narcissistic, and overall wrong. she feels that if biology isn't such a big issue, then i should have no problem telling her whether clark or kent is my biological son, and that accusing her of potential favouritism or something similar with her bio grandchild is an unfair judgement with no actual reasoning to it.\n\nmy boyfriend agrees that i shouldn't tell anyone at least until my sons have decided for themselves if they want to know and want other people to know, but my entire family agree with mum that i'm being unreasonably selfish and that my actions now are more likely to cause issues than mum's potential actions later.\n\nam i in the wrong?", "i

back is weird and that i\u2019d buy her a similar one. this happened saturday night and it\u2019s thursday and she still won\u2019t let it go. she\u2019s barely spoken to me since and is very sulky.

from some very valid things (she doesn't like if someone touches her from behind etc), i never had to tip toe around her disability (she hates it when people pity her or for things differently) \n\nwhen things were getting serious, i mentioned that i don't want kids in the future ever because i don't think it's right for children to suffer in this world for something that's not their fault. maybe it's my fault for being ambiguous, but what i meant to say in a gentle way was that since there is a high chance that our biological children will inherit her disability (not guessing, she told me). but apparently what she understood was that i was childfree and the world is too much a mess (global warming and such) to bring children into. she was okay with it and we went further into our relationship. \n\nthis misunderstanding came to light when we were having a conversation last week and thus began the worst fight in our relationship. \n\nshe asked me whether i would want biological children if i had been with someone without a disability. i admitted \"probably, yeah\". she yelled at me about hurt she was that i would treat her differently when i know how much she hated it. i apologized and told her i was trying to be vague so thay i don't use any hurtful words. i really didn't think the entire thing could be misinterpreted. i apologized and told her i didn't mean to make her think i was childfree etc. \n\nafter that, she started saying subtle things like \"when we have kids/she can't wait to do xyz with her kids\". at first, i thought she was  taking about adoption maybe because i admitted that i wasn't childfree. but it soon became clear that she wanted biological children. so, i sat her down and told her that though i am sorry for how i said it, my decision to not have biological children with her still stands. and i would have done the same thing with anyone with any genetic condition or mental illness. \n\nshe blew her lid off and accused me of being an ableist because i am seeing any disabled child as a burden, so that must mean i see her as a burden too. \n\ni tried to explain that while i don't think any less of her for having a disability, i don't think that it's okay to bring a child into the world that there is a very very very high chance of the baby having a disability. \n\nshe doesn't think the both can be mutually exclusive. she kept calling me an ableist. when i felt we were going in circles, i went out to go for a walk and clear my head. \n\nso, am i the asshole here?", "obligatory throwaway/long time lurker disclaimer, because apparently that matters.\n\na few months ago my (31m) sister (29f) announced that she was going to get married. the planning process took a while but the date and venue were agreed on. now, my sister has a baby (1m) that just loves to cry. he cries all the time, unless someone takes him outside for fresh air.\n\nso a few days ago the wedding started. because i was out of town i missed the night before the wedding (basically a get-together period for family members and a big party) but showed up for the ceremony and reception. the second i got there my sister asked me to take the baby outside in order to calm him down. i agreed because the ceremony hadn't started yet, but she asked me to take the baby outside again a while later. when i asked why the baby didn't have a sitter, she said that they spent all the money on the ceremony and parties.\n\ni was kind of annoyed because i wanted to sit in on the ceremony, but just about everyone jumped on me telling me to do my sister a favour and that \"it was her day\". i asked her about when i was expected to take the baby out for fresh air, and she gave me this huge list of times that basically meant i missed out on the important parts. i wouldn't be there for the exchanging of vows, the reception, the aisle walk, the readings, the kiss, etc.\n\ni figured out that in total i would have about 30 minutes actually sitting inside, and the rest was just about the baby. when i pointed this out to her she said someone would videotape it for me but i wasn't convinced. i wanted to watch my sister reach a milestone, and that was what i came for. i told her that someone else could watch the baby for her, and that as her brother i wanted to watch the wedding, and not have to miss her getting married. again, she told me to \"just do it\".\n\ni was really mad, but tried not to show it on the outside. when i asked about the reception, she told me, \"oh, you'll have to miss out. \\[baby's name\\] needs to be outside and has to be fed.\"\n\nthat was the final straw, and when my mother was holding the baby i slipped out and just left. the next day i get a call from my sister, and she's screaming about how i ruined her wedding and how the baby wouldn't stop crying. i told her that i left because she treated me like a babysitter instead of a guest/family member, and said that it was her fault if she couldn't get a nanny or ask a friend to do it. since then i've been nuked with calls from family calling me selfish and telling me that i'm effectively disowned unless i apologise. i see no reason to. aita?", "i (30f) moved

to find where i am, especially when you're trans.\n\none morning a week ago i was woken up by the roommate (20s m) moving in. i would have liked some notice but whatever. what was really a problem was that he had a small kid. i really didn't like this but had no choice to accept it. i have a really big room with a bathroom so i could deal with just isolating myself away from the rest of the house.\n\nthe problems started immediately. roommate let his kid use my microwave and he just exploded a mysterious substance all over it. i was horrified and demanded the roommate clean it up but he said he was \"too tired from parenting\". so i cleaned it up and put it in my room as well as all my other appliances. my room has the space and while it's not ideal i could fit my fridge, microwave, toaster, etc all in there with a bit of creative setting up.\n\nhe really didn't like this though and demanded i put the stuff back out in the kitchen. i refused and told him to get his own appliances for the kid to destroy. he said he couldn't afford to. i said not my problem and went back into my room and locked it.\n\ntoday i was woken up to him knocking loudly on my door. i was kind of fucking terrified by this strange aggressive man behaving like that so i texted him asking what he wanted. he said he needed me to watch his demon for the day because of a family emergency. i said no because i had plans (scheduled event in an mmo so i couldn't cancel without letting a lot of people down). he kept insisting so i just turned my phone off and ignored him.\n\ni don't know how that situation resolved itself but shortly after i got a call from the landlord asking if i could help with the kid more because the tenant is trying to break the lease over it. i said no i'm not a live in babysitter. he agreed in the end and said that he wouldn't make the mistake of letting a kid live in the house again. i thanked him and we ended the call. \n\njust now i needed to grab something of mine from the living room and roommate was there looking distraught. i tried to ignore him but he just yelled at me \"what kind of so-called woman are you\". that really pissed me off so i said what kind of so-called man needs a live in mommy to wrangle his kid and went back to my room. i felt a little bit bad about that comment but i felt that his transphobic comment was really uncalled for so i

your wedding and then go to work.\n\nmy niece called me to say how sorry she is i won't attend and that it's ok she's not offended. i told her that i am actually offended about how she didn't think this throughout. about how nobody else scolded her on that choice and how many people will now miss out on the wedding for a silly choice she made. she said that date is special for her and her fianc\u00e9 that's why they chose it. i told her of course i understand but she shouldn't just be thinking about her special and unique date and she should accommodate other people. she defended herself and said she understands how it's difficult for many people to attend due to that and she doesn't mind. that made my blood boil because that girl obviously didn't care about the comfort and convenience of her guests and only cared about her own special little date. i told her that.\n\nshe then started cursing me out and told me \"ok who the fuck are you? i fuckin said i understand why people might not be able to attend but my fianc\u00e9 and i wanted that date so whether or not you can make it is your business. just rsvp no and shut the fuck up since i don't owe you any

and i was completely disturbed so i spoke to my fianc\u00e9 and we both decided we had to take action immediately. i went over to my sister's and asked her directly about what she was posting on facebook, she did not deny it and also had no explanation. therefore i told her that she's banned from seeing my daughter. my sister flipped out and said that i can't take kaia away from her and then called me a \"selfish b!tch\" and she started crying. i have never seen my sister act this was before, it was alarming. i ask her if there's anything else i need to know because she may as well just

video games, reading or exercising) or shopping or in the gym.\n\nover the years i got annoyed with this and have asked her to find another job so she has something to do while i'm working instead of

costumed baby and a bag and said \u201csay trick or treat!\u201d as if they deserve something for that.\n\nafter this happening more than a few times, i decided to put my foot down and deny candy to

'no other options' so of course i invited them over and bought a blow-up mattress for the living room.\n\nfor the first month things were manageable, although admittedly cramped. then my brother told me that sleeping on the mattress was giving him back pains, so he asked if he could buy a small double bed for the living room. the living room is by far the biggest room i have, so i told him that would be fine as long as there was still room for my couch/tv/bookshelves.  the living room is also connected to my kitchen in an open plan style, so i reminded my brother to leave walking space around the bed.\n\nit's now been 2+ months and things have gotten a lot worse. when they first moved in, i would still use the living room every day to unwind on the couch after work. now whenever i go in, there's a strange vibe like i'm intruding. my brother and his wife are often sitting in bed together when i go in (i always knock) and stare at me pointedly until i leave. sometimes when i sit down they will directly ask me for some 'alone time' and say they would like the room to themselves.\n\nthis came to a head yesterday when my sister-in-law messaged me with a 'timetable' she'd made of when it would be 'a good time' for me to use the living room. the timetable basically says that they will allow me into the room for an hour each evening, plus 20 minutes around mealtimes.\n\ni basically shut her down instantly and told her there was no way i'd be following the timetable since in the end it's my apartment. she sent me back a huge message with a dozen paragraphs about how my constant presence was 'ruining' her marriage with my brother and they feel like they have no privacy. \n\ni tried to talk this over with my brother that night, but when i got home neither my brother/sil were talking to me, so he's clearly just as pissed. today an amazon parcel arrived for my brother with a lock for the living room door, which i told him there's 'absolutely no way' i will allow him to install. my brother says i'm 'creepy' for wanting constant access to where they sleep and he's insisting on installing the lock anyway.\n\naita for not giving my brother and his wife

grandparents because you abandoned my sister and i after telling us we are the reasons for our dads death and you stole his money from us. don\u2019t you dare talk about my mother either because she did an amazing job with us without any help from you two. i\u2019d be happy with never seeing your sorry faces again.\u201d i started to walk away again and heard my grandmother start to cry, but i

proportioned foods. things that are already packaged in small portions to prevent her from over-snacking. that\u2019s normal, but she gets these small apple sauce pouches and these fruit pur\u00e9e pouches, small low calorie snacks that are literally made by gerber and they\u2019re intended for literal babies. \n\nshe likes them bc to her, they taste good, they\u2019re low calorie, and again,

every time we have family or friends over they always comment on that food being in the fridge and some even question if we have a kid or not. it\u2019s just annoying and unnecessary. \n\nso i asked her to stop buying these snacks and get something more \u201cgrown up\u201d and she simply said \u201cno\u201d. she even tried to show me on her phone that what she\u2019s doing is common and that so many other adults eat these snacks but i wasn\u2019t buying it so it broke into a whole fight, where i was calling her immature and saying she had to grow up (i know, that was rude) and she was saying that im being a dickhead for getting mad at her for something that she says is harmless. \n\nam i the asshole for wanting her to grow up and eat food that\u2019s actually not intended for infants??", "my sister has a large-ish instagram following ( like 10k followers) and her ig mostly talks about veganism, cruelty free recipes, fashion ,stuff like that. i have a little fashion page, it is something i do for fun. we both live with our grandmother. she\u2019s 22 i\u2019m 19. \n\nmy grandmother collects clothes. we have been going through her collection for a couple of hours a day, and finding some really cool vintage stuff from the 50s-80s. everything is in pristine condition. my sister and i have both asked to have a lot of stuff.  my sister is smaller than me so had an easier time fitting into all of the cool bohemian stuff from the late 1960s (grandma was in her mid 20s) a lot of the things in my size were 80s jumpsuits, not my thing. \n\ni found several pairs of very cool shoes. the most iconic of them all being a pair of white patent leather gogo boots with beautiful beading down the side and some suede thigh highs with a little fringe. i found them first. i knew i could make a killing online selling them, so i rushed to ask my grandmother if i could have them. she initially said yes, but when my sister saw them she begged to try them on. of course they fit her. they didn\u2019t fit me. she begged my grandmother to let her have them and she said that she would think about it. \n\nmy sister asked me what i was going to do with them, and i told her that i was going to sell them! i could get between $800- $1000 for them. she shamed me for trying to sell grandmas stuff. she said that she would actually wear them and take care of them, so she deserved them. i disagreed. i also pointed out that she was vegan, why she would want leather shoes anyway. she said that used stuff and heirlooms don\u2019t count. she went off to talk to my grandmother by herself that night. my grandmother ended up giving the shoes to her. \n\nmy sister got all excited and was trying the shoes on with a bunch of different outfits. i asked her if i could take a picture of some of the outfits, she let me. i posted them to my ig, tagged her in the pictures and mentioned everything she was wearing, including the leather boots. my post happened to get a lot of engagement from her followers, and a lot of them were mad. she ended up losing like three hundred followers, and it became kind of a scandal. \n\nshe got mad at me and caused me of trying to sabotage her for captioning the picture the way i did, and being jealous that she got the shoes. she told me to take the picture down. i did. she said that i could cost her or lose sponsors and money. i pointed out the money she cost me by sucking up for those shoes that i found first. \n\nshe hasn\u2019t lost any more followers, and has been doing damage control, but she\u2019s still angry at me. i think she\u2019s a hypocrite for wearing the shoes in the first place, and i asked her before taking the pictures. but i feel bad about how stressed out she\u2019s feeling and the crazy backlash that she\u2019s receiving, so aita for posting them?", "backstory, im 19, 6ft1 and i use tinder frequently. i also used to be really short, like up until 17 i was sub 5ft7 and got rejected because of my

of jokes about footstools, and calling her out for having those preferences. also, she isn't the thinnest girl around, not fat or whatever, but anyway, i jokingly asked her what a fat girl was doing

college options which he was going to decline to stay in our town and marry fran. i obviously didn't support this, i wanted my son to go to college and knew he wanted that too as he'd always been ambitious. i told my son that he had his whole life ahead of him and he could get married later, but didn't need to rush it. i told him that if he went to college and waited, even just a year or two, i'd pay for his tuition. at the time i didn't know how serious their relationship was as they'd been together for a little over a year, and was scared it wouldn't work out and he'd waste this opportunity. my son happily accepted this offer and agreed with me that it would be best to wait.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthis year my son graduated college but maintained a long distance relationship with fran, and they announced their engagement a couple months ago. we were all ecstatic about it. sometime between then and now, my son told fran that i was the reason he waited until now to propose. i wasn't aware until christmas when during dinner, fran said she wanted to say something. she began saying i paid my son to not married her and actively tried to ruin their relationship. she then said she was blessed that 'evil hadn't won' and couldn't wait to have a long and happy marriage. everyone was silent and didn't really know what to say. my son approached me later to apologise and said she had twisted his words but it's been constantly weighing on my mind as friends and family present all have different opinions.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**edit**\n\nif my son had married fran out of high school, he wouldn't of gone to college. my son chose to go to a school so far away, there were closer options but he liked the school he chose. i will be showing dan this thread and update if he responds. fran currently works at her mothers bakery. she wants to be a sahm once they get married and was waiting for dan to come back home.\n\n**update**\n\ndan and fran have talked and cleared the air around this situation. fran feels awful about what she said and realised she should've come and talked to me privately. this situation however has brought up other issues between the two and their future, as dan expressed the fran he would like to go to law school. fran wants them to start their life together and thinks it's unfair for dan to make them wait for 4+ years. dan is currently home

move in. she pays about 30% of the rent because that's all she can afford.\n\nmy roommate has one particularly good friend who she invites over regularly. i do not like that woman at all. she is loud, self-centered, and has no concept of boundaries, property, or privacy. she has \"accidentally\" eaten my food and drunk my beer several times when she came over, and i have voiced my opinion about her

seeing me naked), she burst out laughing as i fumbled to cover myself. by now my roommate had come out of the bathroom, and her friend shouted to her \"i saw his little ____!\" my roommate snort-laughed loudly.\n\nthe next morning my roommate was hung over, and so i told her that her time in the house was over and that she had a month to vacate. i looked up the laws in my state, and since i am the only person on the lease, i can legally kick her out as long as i give her proper notice. she told me that she warned her roommate about privacy after what happened, and i told her i don't care at all. she brought that woman into the house, she was entertained by my embarrassment, and i wasn't comfortable living with her for another day. i told her if it were legal i'd kick her out that second.\n\nmy roommate has been nasty with me all week, saying that she has nowhere to go. i don't care and keep telling her that she might want to start looking. our mutual friend who i originally did the favor for has sided with her completely, and so i just blocked him.\n\nam i going too far here, or am i not the asshole in this case?", "so i've noticed this annoying and demeaning

post, i feel this is incredibly selfish and uncalled for behavior. we live in a society (america), hoarding a public good (seats) like this leads to anarchy in the system (people must stand, sit on the ground, walk far away to find an alternative) as there is less for everyone else (2 seats for 1 person). the final straw that broke the camel's back was when i was at the university library, it was packed, the same \"this seat is taken for a friend who is coming\", and fortunately someone else was leaving and i took their spot, only to witness the woman 45 minutes later leave with no one ever arriving.\n\nafter that whenever i ask if that seat is available and i hear the \"i'm waiting for a friend\" i say \"alright well i'll leave when the friend arrives\", and just sit down. and if the other person arrives, i get up and go. which i think is a fair compromise. though at this point it's exhausting trying to change everyone and so i see a girl telling people that open seat is taken

a sahm should do. so i told him that unless he gives me 50% of his salary for household expenses and baby expenses and contributes at home at least 25%, i will go back to work.\n\n\n\nhe threw a huge fit about it, and i called up my old job, who had been dying to have me back, and set up an interview (a formality honestly, they will take me back with no questions asked).\n\n\n\nhe's sulking,

super low budget. honestly my feelings were a little hurt because when my husband's older sister got married a year ago mil and fil (divorced) went all out, but they are against us getting married because of our ages (both 20) and not being done with school, so they did not offer to help. \n\nmy parents chipped in what they could, but like i said it was super low budget. mil lives about two hours away and we don't see her that much. she has been dating \"chris\" for nine months but we never met him. she wanted to bring him to the wedding which was fine, but to save money we had tier 1 and tier 2. if you were in tier 1 you could pick from an italian sausage, a steak, a hotdog, or a burger for dinner. if you were tier 2 it was just the burger or hot dog, and there was only enough cake for tier 1.\n\nmil and chris ended up to get food and my cousin who was grilling asked what they wanted. no one told them about the tiers so chris asked for steak. my husband overheard and explained the tiers (only family and a couple best friends were tier 1) chris was laughing but said it was okay, but mil made a big deal. she called us rude and tacky 3 times. my husband told her to stop causing a scene, and chris said it was really okay, but she was clearly pissy.\n\nmil texted us the next morning that our \"party\" was embarrassing, and that we are tacky. most of the people

dedicating about $400 dollars a month! to my brother. thing is my allowance is barely a $100 a month. i found out and blew up at my parents and asked for equality and to either split the money between me and my brither or make my allowance same as him but they told me off explaining that my brother has medical needs and require doctors appointmenrs ans medication that they need money for while i'm perfectly healthy. i pointed out how unfair they have been and how they were obviously playing favorits and causing me to resent my brother and driving a wedge between them here but their argument that i should not hate my brother since the money goes to medication and whatnot and not clothes and toys. after further arguing my dad called me an overprivilaged, spolied brat who had no right to \"demand\" anything from them and that i should consider myself lucky i still get a $100 allowance when i'm perfectly capable to work if i don't like it so much.\n\n\ni'm now indefinately grounded for

and asked what i was doing. i told him that since he didnt respect me sleeping, at all, that i would be staying in the guest room from now on. he made a comment about \"the light will only be on for 5 freaking minutes.\" which is not true. he turns the light on, finds himself clothes and then goes to take a shower without turning the light off. if i turn the light off, he will come back into the room after the shower and turn it on again to grab his socks and put on his shoes.

the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. i know this is the case, because i've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.\n\ni've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up

his fiance wanted and thought it would be fun to have a color-coordinated wedding.  \n\nthe problem i have with this is that i only wear black and white. like, i literally do no own any clothing that is not black, white, or a combination of the two.  i do not own any clothes that are blue or bright pink.  i told my brother about this long before the wedding and he just told me that i have plenty of time to find something that will fit the color scheme.  \n\nit was like he has no care for the fact that i don't wear those colors at all.  i complained about it to my parents and my mom offered to take me shopping to find something to wear and she told me it was just one day and that wearing something a different color for a few hours is not going to kill me.  when we went shopping i hated everything she made me try on and she ended up just buying a couple things in the two colors and brought them home.  \n\nthe morning of the wedding i refused to put either thing on.  i had brought my favorite black dress that was more than nice enough for any wedding and decided to wear that instead.  both my mom and dad told me to put on something else, but i refused and eventually my parents

didn't adhere to his color scheme.  so when we were doing family pictures, my brother made a point to tell me that i would not be involved in any of the larger group shots with the wedding party and the rest of our family.  he told me that he's fine with me being in pictures with just our family, but that i would stand out too much in all of the other group shots because i was literally the only person who didn't wear their preferred colors.\n\ni knew this was probably his bride making the decision and i called my brother out on it.  he told me it was his wedding day and he wasn't going to fight with me about it and that this was just the way it is.  he told me he was disappointed that i couldn't do one little thing for him on his wedding day and i told him he was an asshole for making people dress a certain way even if they don't want to.  \n\ni got a lot of weird looks from people during the ceremony and reception.  and my brother and his wife pretty much avoided me completely the

they're my children's uncles, we spend a bunch of time together and we get along great. i recently had a vasectomy, i'm 44, we have 3 kids and we aren't planning on having any more. after one sunday lunch with our bils, we sent the kids away and us adults had some drinks and started talking about my vasectomy. at one point, i said how great it was to finally not have to worry about protection, and how great it felt without it. and i said i almost feel sorry for them not experiencing it. my bil laughed and said: what are you talking about, we haven't used protection since high school.\n\ni was going to reply something, but the kids came running in so i dropped the topic. i later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that i don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? she told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.\n\ni thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it. so i figured i would buy some condoms and give them to my bils and tell them i was worried about their safety and that they should really rethink not using protection.\n\na couple of days ago, we had another lunch together, we sent the kids away again, and i gave them the condoms. i rehearsed a whole speech about how i wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe. but, rather than seeing my gesture for what it was - a gesture of care - they were offended. they asked if i am suggesting they shouldn't trust each other? they said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future. and my wife's brother also said that, by the same

year. the school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so i volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head

they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. they argued it was for thier comfort since it\u2019s about 80 here today. i was a little nervous but agreed. apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. i\u2019m so naive i thought initially people were just being charitable but when i saw boys from surrounding schools i knew somthing was up.

apartment and he has several roommates.\n\nmostly it has been going well and thankfully we both still have jobs, except in the first few weeks i started noticing that the bathroom floor was suddenly always wet around the toilet. (the sink is across the room from the toilet so it's unlikely to be from the sink.) at first i thought it might be water but soon realized that it was definitely pee. i asked bf about it nicely, and he apologized and said sometimes he has bad aim. i asked him to try a little harder and he said sure.\n\nthe floor continued to be frequently spattered with piss, and a few weeks later i confronted him about it again because i think it's pretty gross to step in his pee several times a week, and it seems like an easy thing to fix. if he misses the toilet, i think the very least he could do is make sure to wipe it up with toilet paper or a clorox wipe. (the cleaning supplies even live in a cabinet directly over the toilet.) he said sure, sorry, he would try to remember to do that. \n\nanother week has passed and while maybe he's doing this sometimes, i've continued to step in splatters of his pee and wipe it off the floor and clean the floor several times a week. i thought about asking him to just pee into the bathtub or something instead, because i don't understand how you can pee on the floor by accident so often and not notice and not clean it up.\n\nlast night i got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and absolutely stepped in piss for the 12312301298th time. i had had it and i didn't want to pick a fight or ask him again since it seems clear he can't or won't change, so i got one of my dog's wee-wee pads from when he was a puppy (he is well trained now) and cut it up a bit and taped it down to make a sort of \"skirt\" or mat around the floor near the toilet to at least absorb the piss. \n\nbf saw this morning and is furious with me, saying that i'm calling him a dog, comparing him to an animal, etc. honestly, i was not thinking that at all, i just was trying to be resourceful and solve the problem for myself since i don't like piss on my bathroom floor and don't like stepping in it, i didn't feel like arguing about it anymore, and putting a material specifically meant to absorb pee around the area he keeps peeing on by accident seemed like a practical solution. \n\naita?", "i (f20) have three siblings who live at home. m22, m15, m12. my older brother does not work and does not

know that she\u2019s gone to bridal showers that looked like for her friends, but that was quite a while ago and i haven\u2019t seen pink near her for like years.\n\nshe was very mad at me and said that she always imagined her \u201c bridal shower\u201d to have a lot of pink because it is still her favorite color and \u201c royal\u201d purple is my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\u2019s.\n\nshe then

shoulders when he got his first haircut at 4 months old. my daughter is super picky about hair. she pretty much refuses to try out new hairstylists unless necessary and once she finds one she likes won't see anyone else.\n\n\nwell his hair was starting to get pretty long and messy because he hadn't had a haircut in a while, she said she didn't have the money at the moment but would get it cut when she did anytime i mentioned it. i asked if i could take him to get it cut, and she said only if i use his stylist. it's at this one kids place and after tip the haircuts are nearly $30. i said i didn't want to spend that much on a 2 year olds hair and that i'd take him to the place i usually go.\n\n\nshe refused to let me take him if it wasn't hers, so i dropped it. a bit later, we watched him while she was sick, and she had a prescription she asked if we could grab for her. i figured to pass the time waiting for the medicine i'd go get the him a haircut. i took him to my stylist, since they only charge like $10 for kids.\n\n\nwell she wasn't used to cutting childrens hair. she had a hard time cutting it with him moving around so much, and ended up just doing the best she could. it wasn't horrible, but it was fairly choppy and uneven. there was no way she was going to be able to fix it though because he kept pulling away and trying to push the scissors away.\n\n\nanyways, when we took him back home she freaked out the second she saw him asking what the hell we did to her child's hair. i told her i took him to get his hair cut, and she said that this is exactly why she said not to in the first place, now her sons hair is all screwed up and they cut it too short to even be able to take him to get it properly fixed elsewhere without shaving it all off. she was nearly in tears over it. i told her i was simply trying to help out because his hair was getting too long and messy, but she didn't want to hear it. every time i saw her or talked to her after that, she would make a comment about how awful his poor hair looked and she sure hoped it hurried and grew out so she could get it cut properly. \n\n\nshe did get it cut later on, and even during that haircut she was telling the stylist about how i didn't listen to her last time and let someone screw his hair up. well she just told me \"just so you know, when this is over with, you are not getting his hair cut. he can wait until i can take him, even if it's a month or so after i have this baby.\" \n\n\ni thought it wasn't a big deal, but she's still mad, her husband actually seemed upset about it, and my wife

was weird and disgusting and it\u2019s extremely concerning that he\u2019s so affectionate towards me. my brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. i brought him to his room and calmed him down. \n\ni went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. i told her to get the fuck out. she got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. i grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. i didn\u2019t hurt her, she was following me, i didn\u2019t use any force. she left, she called me few times but i didn\u2019t answer.", "\n\ni went with him originally because he's very knowledgeable about it and i said maybe he could show me some of the exercises like how to do squats and such. since then we got in the habit of going together and becoming workout partners. however as this is part of my glow-up period, where i lose weight and get more toned and then hotter guys start to notice me more, i've been thinking there's some cute guys at this gym but if they see me with my friend they'll assume he's my boyfriend.\n\nbecause of this i told him it'd be better if we didn't go together anymore. when he asked me why i explained it to him but he said that was silly of me and claimed even i should be happy if being with him prevented other guys from hitting on me. aita for rather wanting to go on my own from now?", "(not from my husband)\n\nmy husband and i are on our honeymoon. his parents gifted us a week in an all inclusive hotel at no cost to us as a wedding gift, and we were really grateful. on arriving we found out that they'd also booked a room at this hotel for themselves for the whole week and want to do group things. outside of this, we see them maybe 2 or 3 times a year for a couple days at a time as he finds them a bit overbearing at times and they don't really like me.\n\nit's not like they're in the room next door or anything and we can still do stuff in our room alone but they knock on our door regularly, waking us up at 6am, making us get all 3 meals a day with them. we've tried telling them we wanted \"alone time\" for our honeymoon and they shrugged us off saying that's what our room is for. we also tried faking illness to get out of eating with them and they just got room service to our room and sat with us while we faked stomach aches. my husband snapped earlier and said this whole thing was way over the line and they had no right intruding on our honeymoon of all things, and they told us that they paid for this whole thing and that as adults we're allowed to take holidays at the same time to the same place.\n\nwe've been talking and we saved up to pay for our own honeymoon before they surprised us. we still have the money we would have spent in our joint wedding/honeymoon account. there's another town we wanted to go to on our honeymoon and we looked it up and we could get tickets from here to there and then back home for less than \u00a360 total. we could also book a few days in a nice hotel for about half of what's left in our wedding/honeymoon fund and use the remainder of the week we booked off in another town without his parents knowing we'd left until we had.\n\nit's 9pm now, there's trains from here to the other town every hour, plus more half-hourly trains tomorrow.\n\nwould we be the arseholes if we ran away from his parents without telling them?", "i am a single mom of two boys ages 11 and 10. their father and i divorced 5 years ago after i learned he was cheating on me. he got her pregnant either right before he told me, and that was why he confessed, or right after. but our divorce was not an easy one. he wanted to stay \"friends\" and i could not look at him after what he did. he and i were together for over 13 years, he was also a friend before he was my boyfriend/husband and to have him betray me like that and treat me as he had was awful.\n\nhe married his affair partner. they had a daughter within months of our separation, followed by a son after the divorce/their marriage. last year they lost a baby which led to the discovery that his wife had cancer.\n\nwhat followed was a lot of fighting between the two of us again. he wanted me to help him and his wife out. he said their children (who are currently 5 and 3) needed family beyond just him and his wife. his own family disowned him for our divorce (they were extremely religious) and she has no family. i told him it would be over my dead body i would help him. he argued that it was for the children and if not for his kids with her, then for our boys, who could see their family heal and be one. i told him he stopped any chance of that happening when he cheated on me.\n\nwhat i did not expect was for him to tell his daughter's school to call me when she got sick. he was at work at the time and couldn't leave apparently because he had already missed a lot of work due to his wife, and she was home recovering from chemo. i got the call, was asked if i would pick her up and i said no. several hours later i got reamed on the phone by him for leaving his sick child at school when i knew they had nobody. this is when he told me how he couldn't leave and how his wife was resting. i told him the babysitter for his son should have been called over me. he told me he was in daycare and i should be fucking ashamed because she was a sick child who is going through a lot and i could have helped. he told me he hoped our son's were going to be fucking ashamed of me. they aren't. and i argued back with him over the phone at the time.\n\nbut i guess part of me does feel bad for the child. my son's also sensed an atmosphere while they were with their dad after the incident when they talked about me, and i hate that for them.\n\naita?", "my school made the switch from paper to laptops/ipads two years ago, and since then you can really see who's parents have money. i'm currently using some asus my uncle gave

a coworker from work (matt-fake name). fine with me.\n\nwe started playing a card game where you answer questions about yourself; based on the level (level 1, 2, 3), the question could be extremely surface level (ex. what's your favorite color?) to something deeper (ex. what characteristic of yourself do you not like about yourself?). everyone was enjoying themselves, and i was happy with the

about this, the other 2 and matt did not.\n\ni didn't want to bring the mood down, so i answered that the hardest thing i'd been through was transitioning going to a college in a different state where i knew no one. we were all ready to move on, but matt immediately piped up and said, \"wow, if that's the hardest thing you've ever been through, you live an extremely privileged life.\" \n\neveryone got quiet. now, if he had said it jokingly, i probably would have let it go and moved on. however, the way he said it was in a very condescending and patronizing tone, and i will admit, it rubbed me the wrong way. instead of letting it go, i said \"well, the hardest thing i've ever been through is seeing my sister die in the icu and having to watch her being lowered into her grave when i was 17. i just didn't want to bring the mood down.\"\n\nif things were quiet before, they were dead silent now. matt mumbled an apology but game night ended shortly after. after my friends all left, my friend who had brought matt texted me and told me i was a jerk for making matt look bad, and i could have just let his statement go. i do feel bad about what i said and being the cause of game night ending

who has been out of job and complaining about no longer being able to attend the gym took the chair and sold it online to be able to pay for her next month's gym membership. when i found out i flipped out hugely and had a very negative reaction. she told me that she was desperate for money and after selling all she had she had no choice but to sell the chair. i reminded her of who this chair belongs to but she said i already have tons of keepsakes from my brother and so i shouldn't act like it was the end of the world. she also vented about her past eating disorders and her anxiety when it comes to keeping fit and claimed i was dismissing that she is struggling. i yelled at her and called her inconsiderate and selfish and told her she should have never ever took and sold any of my stuff for a gym membership when she literally could-ve kept working out from home. she started crying as we argued then she went to stay with her mom who tried to give me a stern talk about my attitude and but i didn't answer that and haven't been talking to my fiancee since then. things haven't got better and i got called overdramatic for reacting and treating my fiancee like that over a

something and i told her that i already did cook her something and that she threw it away. i told her she can either cook for herself or wait until her father comes home and he can cook for her.\n\ni

eat his sandwich on the the toilet. i said she has been struggling, hasn\u2019t had a bite to eat all while the 3 of you sit there enjoying yourselves and letting her drown.\nand then i said loud

feeding and that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019s doing. \nno one said anything but she also didn\u2019t go to the bathroom and finished feeding her baby who calmed down and she was able to eat. \nmy bf

looked on displeased. of course, toddler decides this is optimal time to start crying, which disrupts an already upset baby, who stops latching and thus my nipple is on show to the world. \n\ni

she was at the door in the first place. \n\ni handed baby off because he was done, but realised toddler wouldn't be done for a while so i succumbed to my fate. sil was still looking very uncomfortable, and i was expecting some form of judgement for still feeding my son, which i got. can always count on the mil.\n\nafter she finished i hoped she'd just leave, but then she made a rather appalling comment of, \"no wonder ex left you, when you're whoring yourself around like that. anyone could of been at the door, and you're off swinging your tits about.\"\n\ni, at this point, broke down crying. my friend (who was upstairs putting the baby down) thankfully takes charge of the situation. gets rid of them, convinces toddler into his bed, and then we watched movies and ate ice cream

the hospital is very expensive i should pay half because we could get a cheaper place if i don\u2019t live near work. she thinks is because we are paying more to live near my work so i don\u2019t have to pay for gas i should pay half for rent. i find she\u2019s being selfish because she makes much more than mean, and once i complete my residency i can easily make $350k a year or more. \n\nbut according to her it\u2019s not fair for her to wait 3 years to \u201cpotentially get paid back\u201d because we could breakup and she would have \u201csubsidized\u201d me. to me if she isn\u2019t willing to pay a bit more to put some skin in the game she\u2019s being a gold digger and waiting for me to make bank without giving anything in the first place. we argued about this a few times and i just want to know if i\u2019m crazy in my thinking or she\u2019s being selfish.", "\n\ni married my husband 7 years ago, i have 2 daughters 13/15 from my previous marriage and he has a son (20) named

\"overlap\". but my husband got too busy to check on tom especially as he got older.\n\nit's been like this for years til recently when my husband said that he's been reconnecting with tom and found out he has cancer. i felt really sorry for him i wanted to visit but he said it wasn't a good idea as tom isn't ready and suggested to me that he use one of the girls college fund to help pay for treatment. i was in dismay when he said that. he explained that tom is understandably distant and he wants to make it up to him after those unfortunate years. i said no but he lashed out saying it's his money, i told him this is his stepdaughters future but he promised he will pay everything back once he's done with this emergency and reminded me this is his son, flesh and blood. i don't know i felt like he meant to say that my daughters don't matter that much to him. i still refused but he said if he asked the girls he was sure they'd want to help their stepbrother. i sternly told him that his family problems aren't mine and my family's and he shouldn't sprint them on me and the girls. he was shocked and got quiet then rushed out and has been staying with tom for a week now. doesn't call or visit unless for the girls. now he's planning on taking them to visit tom. he said they had the right to meet their stepbrother but i see it as a way to pressure them.", "i 30sf have a

just asked, \"oh really? can you elaborate?\" \n\nhe spoke for the next 15 mins about how i misunderstood what the author wrote and went on and on. in the end, i told him that wasn't what the author said. he told me that i couldn't possibly know that. i told him that i knew that because i wrote that goddamn paper. i could literally see him deflating. \n\nhe was in a sour mood for the rest of his

haven't listened and things went back to how they were.\n\nfew days ago my son came downstairs saying his older stepbrother broke his controller and put it back and told him he returned it like his dad told him but the controller was broken. i again went to my boyfriend with this issue and had my son sit and talk directly to him. my son asked him if he could just get a lock for his room to resolve this issue but my boyfriend didn't welcome the idea and told him no because locks bring troubles to his house but my son tried to convince him and assured him that he won't use the lock when he's home but only when he's at school or working. my boyfriend still said no and then told him \"no lock until you're 18, period, no more discussion\". thing is my son will still be living with us because he decided to go to a community college and my boyfriend told him when he reaches 18 that is when he gets to get a lock and start paying rent and no one will bother him. my son begged me to say something since he couldn't take it anymore after his controller was broken but i agreed with my boyfriend that as the owner of the house he gets final say and no lock means no luck. however, the

particular apartment complex because its a lot closer to my work and it has a pretty spectacular gym. the gym fees are built into my monthly rent payment, about $40 and is optional. i elected to pay it because i'm an avid gym-goer. i've been going to the gym at my usual time of around 6:30ish and at first i was oblivious to the fact that during the times that i go, its all women - who usually give me pretty dirty looks but i thought nothing of it. i made a friend in my complex and when she saw me at the gym she was super surprised to see me. unbeknownst to me, there is a women's hour every weekday from 6p-9p. now look. i know that us dudes can be big creeps and it can be annoying for a woman to try to get off a workout in peace. but i think that 3 hours is far too excessive. i ended up leaving that day to keep the peace though.\n\nthose times make it incompatible for me to go the gym which is open 6a - midnight. i work 8:30a to 5:00p and i usually come home at around 5:30ish, depending on traffic. usually i like to chill for about half an hour after getting home to decompress and i either make food for later or just browse the twitter or reddit. now i know that i could wake up early to go....but imma be real honest and say that i'd rather not do that because i like my sleep. what makes it even worse is that the nearest gym is a 40!!!!!! minute drive away. which is a no bueno for me.\n\nso i thought about it and escalated this matter to the strata manager and i asked her about the women's hour because i was not informed of this prior to signing my lease. apparently its not a policy instituted by the strata, but the tenants (who are mostly women) agreed on this policy as a community and the strata neither endorses nor discourages this policy. i was prepared to give up and make do with the other gym but first i inquired about getting my monthly gym fee waived if i won't be going there. strata manager said that she can't do that until my lease is up for renewal in a year. so i said eff that, i won't be paying for a service that i won't use.\n\nso i go to the gym. i make sure to go out of my way to not look at or talk to any of the women there because i want to leave them alone, and vice versa. i just work out and keep my head down.\n\ntoday one woman tapped me on the arm (more like hit me if i'm being real) and said \"you know it's women's hour right\" and i said yeah i know that but the window makes it pretty much impossible for me to work out at other times so i have to go now. oh and please don't touch me. she got pissed and told me to get out. i refused and ignored her and continued my workout whilst all the other women gave me extremely dirty looks. aita?", "this isn\u2019t necessarily my proudest moment but i am tired of being

up to the apartment she had prior having insane high rent.\n\nshe stuck to the 50/50 arrangement at first concerning bills but she missed often and i had to remind her about it. post-engagement, she's back to living paycheck to paycheck, either missing or very late with her part of the rent monthly, the two utilities we pay, groceries, late with her car payment. her parents have talked to me multiple times about rent and i've covered her missing portion to get us caught up, and then try talking to her. it always turns into her saying we should just move if her parents are going to hound us. i told her we're lucky its her parents because anywhere else would've kicked our asses out. on top of that, i pay my own bills, do about 65% housework, arrange and pay for most of our dates and vacations, gifts for her, pay most towards our pets.\n\ni've suggested a financial coach but what kicks me is whenever we're around others, she boasts about being the breadwinner since she earns more. goes on about the stresses of being the main source of income, all the hours she has to work to \"pay all our bills\". i was letting it slide until few days ago we were at a get together. she and her sister started up again about her being the breadwinner. her sister said something to the effect of her ex-boyfriend had a hard time being with someone who earned more, and my fianc\u00e9e went \"good thing op doesn't mind me bringing home the pay\".\n\ni told her just because she earns more doesn't make her the breadwinner when she blows it all on herself and i'm paying most the bills. she's embarrassed now and keeps saying i made her look bad and got her in trouble with her parents because they want to see what she spends her money on each month, but i don't think i did anything wrong.

bought for her. \n\n\n\nmy parents bought her a doll house and some clothes and i bought her a remote controlled car and some toy binoculars. aunt lola and poppy was very happy and accepted the gifts but my uncle looked annoyed when he saw what i'd bought for poppy.\n\n\ni asked him if something was wrong and he asked me why i bought \"boys toys\" for his daughter when she was a girl. i asked him if he is saying only boys can play with remote controlled cars and binoculars and he said yes. he asked me why i didn't buy her a doll or a kitchen set or something more feminine. i stared at him incredulously and told him that anyone can play with these and toys aren't gendered, but he kept insisting they are and started to get angry.\n\n\nmy mom told me to let it go but i found it ridiculous that he was already restricting his daughter's choices at such a young age and forcing her to be \"feminine\".\nuncle jesse then said \"if i had had a son, then these gifts would be acceptable. unfortunately it is lola's fault that she gave me a daughter, so don't give poppy such masculine gifts.\"\n\n\ni knew my uncle wasn't very educated but this was the dumbest thing i had ever heard someone say. i informed him that it was his sperm that decided poppy would be a girl, it isn't lola's fault at all. that lola has xx chromosomes and he had xy chromosomes and i basically went on a rant explaining how everything works. he was extremely angry after this and told me to stop lying and to shut up. he picked up poppy and told lola that they're leaving, they took only the gifts my parents brought and asked my parents to \"teach this idiot manners\". my dad yelled at him for saying this and my mom didn't say much to them but told me i had stepped out of line. that i should have just stayed silent and ignored what he had said. she said i was extremely rude. \n\naita?", "this happened ages ago and has been an ongoing joke in my family for years, they think i'm definitely ta

the baked beans had spread over and was soaking the edges of my waffles. i don't like the way it makes my crispy waffles soggy so decided to trim the edges of my waffles with my knife and fork. my dad saw me doing this and said very condescendingly \"pfft what are you doing?! it all gets mixed up in your tummy anyway\" and laughed to himself.\n\ni know it gets all mixed in my tummy anyway. but before that it has to go in my mouth and i don't want cold, soggy, slightly tomatoey potato on my tongue because it's gross. i'm also annoyed that he called belittled my eating habits in front of the whole family and made fun of me for something that has absolutely no effect on him whatsoever.\n\nso i got up, walked round to where my dad was sitting, picked up his glass of beer and poured it over his dinner. he tried to grab my hand and stop me, but it was already too late. he shouts \"what are you doing!?\" and i said \"what's wrong, it all gets mixed up in your tummy anyway\"\n\ni remember my older brother and sister thought this was hilarious, my mum was annoyed that i ruined the dinner she'd made for my dad (fair enough, sorry mum) and my dad was furious. i said he shouldn't have made

roasted the veggies in olive oil? there's olive oil in the salad dressing? the pasta isn't whole wheat? this is white bread? yes. vegan, all of it, but not stripped down to as few calories as possible. anddddd now she won't eat, just sat there and tore one of the rolls up into tiny pieces until the table was cleared.\n\nmy brother texted me later that night about how fucked up it was that she had to go home hungry, and this is where i may be the asshole. i replied something in the effect of saying i thought i had to cook to accommodate veganism, not an eating disorder. he told me to go

and she was 100% correct. it was better to see straight than be clouded by emotions. by that time, sarah had come out of the bathroom and was shocked to see fred in tears. she kept on getting hysterical and asking what was wrong. i knew that katie's presence would ruin things further, and i asked her to get out. she looked incredibly hurt and angry, but went out anyway.\n\nfortunately, our parents were late and didn't have to see the whole spectacle. when they came home and found out what had happened, they were shocked and upset at katie too, but mom thinks that perhaps i shouldn't

informed the family about nate being diagnosed she has done nothing but intentionally push his buttons at every family gathering, outing or whenever we are together. \n\nmy parents have talked to my uncle and aunt about this but they brush it off calling it pranks.  \n\nnow my parents will not under any cost damage relations with my dad's brother and his family or my dad's other siblings. \n\nnone of my other cousins like kira or her family. we are forced to be cordial because of our parents. kira has to be invited every time us cousins hang out together, most of the time ending with nate being triggered by kira. \n\nthe day before yesterday we all planned to watch a movie. our parents knew this so of course they told kira's parents who told her. she messaged me and asked me where and when we were all were supposed to meet at. my brother had been really looking forward to this movie and meeting our cousins after a few months in person. he had also been in a really good mood and i didn't want kira to ruin it so i did what i thought was best at the time. i gave her the wrong timing. i told my cousins and nate what i did and they were fully onboard. \n\nafter the movie finished, we came out of the theater and waited for some time in the parking lot. as soon as we saw kira pulling over, waving at us, all of us waved back with the sweetest smiles, made a run for our cars, got in and left. \n\nas expected when me and nate reached home we were  immediately ambushed by our parents about why we 'abandoned' kira. apparently she had cried all the way home. \n\nmy parents grounded me and nate for 2 weeks. he surprisingly took it well and said it was worth it. the rest of my cousins were grounded as well. i did text them telling them they could tell their parents it was my idea but my cousins refused and reiterated what my brother had said.\n\ni thought that was the end of it but my parents have been really hurt by this and said me and nate humiliated

got the chance i sneaked out of my uncle's house and went straight to a women's shelter. they helped me apply for asylum. i am now a proud citizen of the great white north, i even got a maple leaf tattoo the day after the paperwork was complete. i'll never forget the first time i bit into a pulled pork sandwich. i almost cried. it was like tasting freedom.\n\ni am now married to an incredible man with two kids (8m and 7f). he's also an ex-muslim, but was born and raised in canada. his parents are first-generation pakistani, and well, they don't like me very much. they blame me for my husband's atheism, even though he's told them several times he was an atheist before we met.\n\nthe biggest point of contention is how differently they treat our kids. one incident in particular that a caused a pretty big fight was when my kids told me their grandparents prevent my son from cleaning up after himself and make his sister do it. my husband reamed them pretty hard about this, so i was hoping they'd start to respect our boundaries, but yesterday i found something that really bothered me.\n\nwe pay my sil (16f) to babysit. yesterday when i got home from work, i saw she'd forgotten to log out of her facebook. i went to log her out, but then something caught my eye - it was a picture of my kids with their grandparents, my daughter wearing a hijab. i investigated further, and realized my in-laws were blocking me from seeing these pictures.\n\nit felt like steam was coming out of my ears. i understand to many westerners it's just a piece of cloth, but to ex-muslim women it's a symbol of our oppression, and i don't want my daughter wearing it until she's old enough to understand what it represents. if she decides to wear it as an adult i won't stop her, but for now, i don't want her wearing it.\n\nmy husband and i made this crystal clear when they first bought my daughter a hijab, and we told them to return it. they tried to convince my daughter it was just for dress-up, and that just pissed me off more because they don't even let my sil wear makeup. they don't care about dress-up, they care about brainwashing my kids.\n\nmy husband and i banned the kids from his parents house, and now his whole extended family is sending us nasty messages. it looks like we're going to have to find a new babysitter, too, but that's a price i'm willing to pay to prevent my children from being brainwashed. are we assholes?", "so, i'm 36f. my husband is 38m and we have been together 14 years. our kids are 15m, 14f and 11m. up until about 2 years ago my kids all

makes me an ah, i think. \n\nanyways, my husband hardly ever lifts a finger when it comes to house work. he doesnt cook, clean or even take the trash out anymore. he used to all the time. \n\nso, i hit a breaking point one day when i came home after a weekend business trip with work to a completely in shambles house. there were dirty dishes scattered and placed in various corners of my home, trash wasnt taken out, laundry was spewing over the top of our hamper, toothpaste lining the sink, etc. you get the point. i grabbed myself a nice tall glass of crown royal and went to my backyard, where i proceeded to sit and do nothing. \n\nmy husband and kids returned home a few hrs later and i chuckled to myself as they stop dead in the doorway, look at the mess and then back at me. my husband says \"hunny, i have my boss coming for dinner tonight. did you forget?\" so i said, \"nope, what are you making for dinner?\" he just sort of looked at me but i think he realized what was going on and went in to start cooking dinner. my daughter lost it. shes like \"how am i supposed to have my boyfriend come over to a house looking like this?\" so i said \"hmm, good question. maybe you should cancel.\" my oldest son (bless his heart) said \"melanie, we can easily clean the house. it's obvious that mum needs a break\". he went in and cleaned the entire house but not in time for my husband's boss to show up and see our home in disarray. my daughters boyfriend also saw the house in shambles and looked disgusted. my daughter started crying and saying i embarrassed her and she

raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. she also happens to like this singer so i asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. i said i can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. she said she'd love to go, but only as friends. she says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. she told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. i said i'll think about it. i was quite hurt because honestly i don't have much experience with rejection, and i was annoyed that she turned me down. \n\ntoday, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. she immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. still, i'm taking her out for drinks on friday. but just now, the friend who i asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. i told her honestly that i already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.\n\nwhen i told my sister about what happened, she said i'm being really douchy. she says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and i should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. i said she can't understand because she's not a dude. because let's me honest, if i had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my \"friend\" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously i'm taking the second one. aita for just being honest about what i want?\n\n**edit**: because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: yes i would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. nowhere do i even say that we have to share a bed...\n\nbut the part where she says she\u2019s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. she likely said she\u2019ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. so why would i make the

to be infertile and now they have a newborn at home\". i replied saying that i'm happy for them, but every case is different and in my case it's completely not possible because i don't have any uterus. he was furious, started to yell that i should have told him that in the first place, that i mislead him. from my point of view i told him enough and he is adult so he made conscious decision

my mom about a part of our state that i love to visit and she mentioned that she has never been there.  i told her we should go together sometime and we started planning it.  we ended up deciding on going there for my birthday.  during the planning we realized that my mom, my brother, and i had never been on a trip together, just the 3 of us, so we invited my brother too.  my husband was fully supportive of us taking this trip and would be staying home with our 3-year old son and our dog.  \n\nbefore we left last week my husband gave me the gifts he bought me for my birthday.  he got me some comfy pajamas, a sun hat, and some good wine and cheese to bring with on the trip.  normally, i would be totally ok with that gift as we don't really splurge on bday gifts anymore.  but he had been talking about getting me a smart watch and new luggage for my trip ever since we started planning it.  \n\nhe knows i can be kind of picky about gifts as i have exchanged some of the gifts he's got me in the past for different colors or options.  but this time i told him to just pick something out for me as i want those things for the trip.  he offered instead to go shopping with me so that i could pick out exactly what i want because if i take them on the trip and don't like them, it's not likely i could return or exchange them. i thought that was a good idea, but life got busy and before i knew it, it was the week of our trip and we hadn't had a chance to actually go shopping together.  \n\nso the time comes for us to leave and part of me was expecting my husband to surprise me with a new watch or weekend bag, but he didn't.  i admit i was pretty disappointed that he didn't take the initiative to just get me those things on his own.  i tried not to let it bother me during the trip, but it was always kind of in the back of my mind.\n\nafter we got back, i mentioned to him that i was disappointed that he didn't get me the watch and bag like he said he would.  he told me that he thought we had agreed to do it together but i told him he knew how busy we were and it wouldn't have been much effort for him to just do it on his own.  \n\nhe got offended and told me that i just spent thousands of dollars on a nice, relaxing trip with my family while he stayed home and took care of everything, and i'm complaining about a watch and a bag?  i told him that he knew how much i was looking forward to having those items for my trip and i'm just disappointed that he didn't realize that and take the opportunity to do something special for me.  \n\nhe apologized for \"ruining my trip\" but i know it wasn't sincere and he's just telling me what he thinks i want to hear.  i offered to go shopping with him sometime to pick them out and he told me to just go do it myself.

showed up 'unsolicited' to a couples event my fianc\u00e9e (27f) was invited to 'in a professional capacity'. she is currently very pissed at me.\n\nmy fianc\u00e9e is an attorney. she's been working at a firm for some time since graduating law school. every year the local bar association organizes this event where attorneys from the area are invited to network and see some old palls from college. the invitation also goes out to the partner of said attorney.\n\nlast year i went together with her and had a merry good old time. i saw some guys there, who also work at her firm, that frequent the performance engine shop where i work as a mechanic. we share similar interests and we pretty much hit it off immediately (we still hang out every now and then). the event got pretty rowdy towards the end (contrary to popular belief a lot of these attorney types aren't the goody two-shoes they pretend to be) and i (amongst others) ended up on stage singing to classics such as journey's 'don't stop believin'' (fucking love that song). \n\nhowever, my fianc\u00e9e ended up experiencing that night very differently. she pretty much went off by herself during the entire thing. she told me she spent the night networking with a few established attorneys and some old acquintances. she also told me she got a bit embarassed by my actions towards the end and that she would like to put on a professional demeanor in front of her colleagues and expected that of me too. \n\nnow, mind you, we often go off the deep end in the weekends and she doesn't have a problem with me acting like the fool i am then!\n\nso last week when i mentioned how excited i was to go with her again this year, she flat out rejected me! she told me i wouldn't be able to properly behave myself in front of her fellow members of the bar and that was that. i tried promising her that i would be on my best behavior, but \"no means no!\" was the final answer. \n\nwhy would you be embarassed of going to an event with your significant other just for being the person he is? certainly if that very partner promises to be as innocent as grace itself! the event is literally meant for couples...\n\ninitially i wasn't gonna go, but my newfound friends whatsapped me and i thought \"to hell with it\". so i got there early, joined up with them (saying she was gonna run late), texted her, had a few drinks, and when she arrived almost got dragged out of the party. i got stomped into my car with strict guidelines to go home and was whipped into motion! not wanting to make a scene i drove off, got two honey butter chicken biscuits from whataburger and spent the rest of the night netflixing. fun times. \n\na week later she is still pissed as hell at me for not respecting her boundaries. i've been sleeping on the couch since then. in the meanwhile i can sort of find the humor in her not wanting to lose face in front of her fancy pants colleagues because of her 'oddball' (it truly isn't that bad tho)

dinner + got her a bicycle, something she had wanted for a while.\n\nmy older daughter (15) was upset at our 'favoritism', because she's always been a straight-a student and we never 'showered her with praise' like we did with her sister. i tried to explain to her that her sister faced difficulties that she never had to deal with and i asked her to be more understanding, plus i also reminded her that we always brought her out for a nice (and expensive) dinner whenever she came back with her good results.\n\nwe got in a bit of an argument and she kept bringing up the bike, even though i repeatedly stated that it was a perfectly reasonable reward. things have been tense between us, my husband agrees with me but my mother tells me that i'm playing favorites, which i really don't think

son was sick and that's why she was late. she didn't want to eat on lunch break and she didn't bring anything so we invited her and offered some snacks. one thing i noticed was that she had her sunglasses on the entire time. yes, we were outside but she never took them off. i looked at the sunglasses and it downed on me that they were a brand made for men. i didn't know if she knew and whether she intended on wearing them, so i casually pointed it out to her and told her that she was wearing men's sunglasses, she looked at me and asked so what. i said i figured maybe she didn't notice but it was obvious to everyone else that she was wearing men's sunglasses this entire time. my co workers started laughing and nancy suddenly got up from her seat and excused herself. my female co worker side eyed me then said that nancy was obviously concerned for her sick kid and there was no reason for me to be fixated on her sunglasses and humiliating her infront of everyone. i said i was just letting her know but she said that really it was non of mg concern and i overstepped. i told her i casually just brought it up without any bad intentions but i was told i needed to apologize to nancy later which i didn't because i don't think i said something out of line or overstepping i was just talking about the sunglasses since i have knowledge in these brands. besides that if i didn't point this out to her, someone else would've. my male co workers thought that nancy was being too sensitive and i was good and didn't to apologize but they could be biased since they always

trying to stay neutral in what has become a messy separation. \n\nmy brother told his wife he's gay by sitting her down, and saying he had been sleeping with two different men for about six months. he said he is now sure that he feels romantic feelings for men, and also told her he has been sleeping with random men from grindr for over a year behind her back. she obviously freaked out, asked him how he could do this, why didn't he tell her when he started having the feelings, etc. he said that he's always thought he was gay but he didn't want to come out because it might affect his career. she asked him what about the effect on her life? she is now a single mother to two toddlers. he was essentially very angry that she wasn't supportive of this, so he kicked her out of the house, with the kids. after she eventually found a place to stay, my brother moved in one of the men he has been having an affair with. \n\nsince then, he has had very little contact with the kids, as in speaking to them on the phone once a week maybe. he has expressed that he still doesn't want to be public about coming out, so he posted on facebook that he has separated from his wife because they aren't in love anymore and hinted she was the unfaithful one (posting things like 'yeah, seems like someone in this relationship wasn't satisfied with just one man') and is basically being a dick.\n\ni told him a couple weeks ago that he's a fucking asshole and i don't want to be involved with him anymore because i think it's disgusting that he's treated his wife like this. i told him i get that you have to come out in your own time, but you don't need to kick her out, ignore your kids and berate her, and you don't need to make comments that people will assume mean she was being unfaithful (he said this was a joke about him having two partners now? still fucked up). he said i'm being a homophobic asshole, and that i don't know how hard it is to come out. he said that if i don't accept him, i'm a bigot. he made mistakes and what not. i said maybe i will forgive him if he improves his behaviour to his wife, and he said he resents her for keeping him from sleeping with men for years. i gave up

years old. jack's mom died when he was 10, but thankfully we both handled our grief together quite well.\n\nwhen jack got his first laptop, five years ago, i took my time explaining how the internet worked, the dangers, etc. i allowed him to create a social media account, as long as he allowed me to check on it whenever i wanted, which was a privilege i made use of a few times until he turned 15 and i realized i could trust him, having never asked for it since then. he allowed me to know where he stored his account passwords just in case, but i never really looked for them, so his social

bothered to remove it.\n\nmy sister and i were talking about this in a casual conversation regarding privacy and privacy apps and my niece overheard us (they were born the same year). she got offended

was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. \n\nthis is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. his only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. but to my huge surprised i was named as his sole heir with life changing money. with the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. \n\nhere's where it gets even stickier. my mom passed away 6 years ago. she had one sister who i was fairly close to and from her i have 3 cousins. i don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was \"it's between the two of them.\" i have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and i don't know if they ever met him. to be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like i did. cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral i set up for my grandpa either. \n\n\nnow she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that i split the estate 5 ways. \n\nthis is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:\nno matter what i shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. if i do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. \n\ni can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as \"enough\" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. the first attorney strongly advised i do this. \n\ni do nothing. i am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. this is my second attorney's preferred course of action. \n\nbut this is not about the legality of the situation. this is about what should i do and would i be the asshole if i keep the entire estate for myself. just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. i have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. i could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. \n\nbasically, wibta if i don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?", "i (42 f) met my

bond with her sine her mother isn\u2019t around to do so. she always would call me by my first name but for the first time when we were sitting at the table for dinner she called me mom and it just

up a bit. my husband and i were arguing all night telling me that what i did was awful, he told me that she feels comfortable and close enough to me to call me mom and i should feel special for her

phone. he came in, didn\u2019t say much (i\u2019m 6\u20192, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. as she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. \n\nnow, i still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that i was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. i felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. the cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. she thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so i think she\u2019s ok. \n\nps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. \n\ni still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying i was wrong in

them out by making some smoked salmon souffles for dinner. i was a little nervous because i had never tried out this recipe before, but they turned out great. i also made a devil\u2019s chocolate cake for dessert. \n\nfor the side dish, i put together a salad with lettuce, arugula, mixed berries, and a strawberry balsamic vinaigrette. it was really tasty, and i thought it would be a good idea to make enough so that everyone could have it as a side and my cousin could have a large portion for her meal. i also made sure to keep the dressing separate from the salad because i knew it had honey in it. \n\nmy cousin said she appreciated that i kept her in mind but that it seemed like her dinner was an \u201cafterthought\u201d and that salad wasn\u2019t a meal on its own. she said if i had told her i was only making her a salad she would have brought a dish of her own to share.\n\nthis really rubbed me the wrong way because i feel like i did go out of my way to include her. aita?", "\nmy son

with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted.\n\n\nhe told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but i don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while i work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a

us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. he said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. we kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a \"like it or not\" attitude with us and kept refusing to discuss this wirh us saying we have no right to be upset with him and should just accept it. but i'm just...i think that he's being inconsiderate of my husband's and i's struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly.\n\n\neta okay, it seems that i did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything.\n\neta okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that i'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. he doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. he adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. also, my husband said the girls are too young for therapy

give them to our daughters. \n\nher wedding day comes around and i just can\u2019t bring myself to give her the letter. i read it and just wanted to keep it to myself. i had his handwriting and his

reservation because i wanted to feel mature (lo) my dad said no a bunch of times but i ended up convincing him. we were supposed to leave today but when he came to pick me up, my step-sister was there, he said it was a surprise since ''both of his girls'' were graduating, apparently she begged him to come with us and he agreed, saying that she could get his bed and he'll sleep on the floor between us. i could feel my eyes burning and i told him that this wasn't the deal, he tried to convince me but he ended up leaving with her.\n\nin my rage, i called the hotel to cancel the room and i didn't told my dad. when they arrived he tried to check in and when he couldn't, he called me, i only said ''yeah, i cancelled it.'' and hung up. he sent me a long text apologizing and my mom said that what i did wasn't okay and that i owe them an apology, apparently they're on their way back because they couldn't find an hotel.", "the past couple of months, my wife has been complaining about our cats. she\u2019s been claiming that the cats wake her up constantly and that she\u2019s frustrated every night that she \u201chas to get up and open the door for the cats\u201d or \u201cthe cats keep making noises\u201d or \u201cthe cats keep jumping on her.\u201d it got to the point where she started saying she wants me to get rid of them. i told her i\u2019ve never seen or heard any of this, but she claims i sleep through it all.\n\nshe kept telling me she was getting less and less sleep and kept acting aggressive, blaming lack of sleep from the cats, and that if i didn\u2019t get rid of them, she\u2019d leave me. i legitimately started considering giving the cats to my sister, until i noticed something.\n\none morning she claimed she had gotten up multiple times throughout the night to help the cats. she listed a bunch of times. i thought it was weird, because i had been up until 4am, and she claimed that she \u201cgot up at 1am to open the door for them, and a few times around 3am because they were meowing and jumping on her.\u201d i was in the bedroom the entire time while she slept, and i know none of that happened. things weren\u2019t adding up, so i decided to run a test.\n\ni waited until she said she was going to bed, then i let the cats out of our bedroom, lowered my phone brightness, and faked going to sleep. i just laid there in bed for the entire night, bored, but i definately did not fall asleep. i made sure to make timestamps every 30 minutes on my phone through discord just to be sure. i marked down every noise my cats made. one cat had jumped down from something and made a little sound at 3:18am, and one ate food relatively quietly by the bedroom door at 4:57am. other than that, nothing happened.\n\nsure enough, my wife slept from 11pm until 9am, and that morning she claimed she had woken up \u201cat least 7 times\u201d to open doors and from cat noises and cats jumping on her. at this point i was pissed because she was clearly lying to me. i was exhausted and fed up with the lies, so i just bluntly called her out on it.\n\ni told her, \u201cthat\u2019s funny. i stayed up all night to monitor the cats, and they weren\u2019t even in the room at all last night. i have timestamps and everything. so you\u2019ve been ***lying*** to me and trying to convince me to get rid of my cats? why?\u201d she just sat there quitly shaking and looking pissed, then got up and left without answering. she came back hours later and ignored me whenever i talked, and when i asked her how **i\u2019m** the bad-guy in this situation, **she finally said that i was treating her like a child by lying about sleeping and staying up all night just to see if she was lying or not** and that making timestamps and everything as if i was an investigator was \u201cgoing too far\u201d and makes me an obsessive asshole.\n\ni did it because she was threatening to make me get rid of my cats or she\u2019d leave me, and her claims didn\u2019t add up.\n\nso, am i an \u201cobsessive asshole?\u201d\n\n\n**", "so my (25f) older brother (28m) and his bf (26m) have been dating for like 4 or 5 years now and recently my brother proposed. everyone has been super supportive and happy for them, my parents are over the moon and excited for the first of their children\u2019s weddings. and im also really happy for my brother, but there was one thing that bothered me. my brother pays for everything. he is constantly surprising his bf with gifts, he always pays for their dates or meals when they go out.\n\ni've brought it up before and my brother says he doesn't mind, that our family have more money than most and that he likes treating his bf. his bf does work and does do the cooking and keeping their house(which my brother brought btw) clean, but that's nothing compared to what he's getting in return. my brother also vaguely explained that there is a \u201cdynamic\u201d to it (he didn't really wanna talk about it with me) which i don't really get and the whole situation still looks like my brother is getting exploited.\n\nlast night my family went out for a celebratory dinner for the engagement. while we were there my brother started showing them the ring and shared plans for what they would want at the wedding, then the bill came, we split it (my parents paying for theirs and my youngest sister\u2019s (16f), me and my bf (29m) split ours, my siblings (31f, 23m, 20f) all paid for theirs) and like always my brother paid for both his and his bf\u2019s. \n\ni joked and said that my brother should get a prenup, my brother told me that isn't funny, i said back that with how many gifts he's gotten him and how many things his bf has his name on it probably won't do much anyway. his bf looked guilty and upset, my brother told me i was being super fucking rude and he and his bf left. most of my family are telling me i was out of line, tho my older sister agrees with me that she thinks our brother is being exploited.

my wife and i have 2 kids ( 8 betty, and 3 sarah).  during making the meal, my sil sent chase to the corner store for some milk.   when he came back, he had two bags of sweets with him. my kids immediately wanted some and asked. chase told them no. i told him that he shouldn't have brought sweets into the house without expecting to share with his cousins. sarah in particular started throwing a bit of a fit the sweets were her favorite. i told him again to share. chase told me no, went to his room and hide the sweets.\n\nat this point he was being immature so i told him to get the sweets and i would give them out after dinner. my brother said to leave chase alone, he doesn't have to share. i pointed out that he caused sarah to have a tantrum. he was sent to get milk not sweets.\n\nsarah eventually calmed down but after the dinner, she went into another meltdown cause chase opened the sweets and again didn't share. not one. i called chase selfish over this but he just went to his room and locked the door. we tried giving her slices of cake and pie but she continued to have a meltdown till my sil asked us to just leave cutting the visit short. we ended up stopped at a store to buy her some sweets.\n\ni don't think it was much to ask for chase to share with his younger cousins.\n\naita?", "title says it all. my friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn\u2019t realize gaming could be so expensive. she dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn\u2019t even have candy crush on her phone.\n\nso i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn\u2019t do it).\n\nafter dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn\u2019t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.\n\naita?", "tim and i met in an english literature class our junior year of college, and we\u2019ve been together the ten years since. while he ended up going into it, i stayed in the liberal arts track and ended up doing non-profit work after college when i realized i didn\u2019t actually want to be a schoolteacher. just to say that we always assumed he\u2019d out-earn me by a considerable margin, though when he made more i always insisted we split things evenly to avoid potential resentment down the road.\n\ni\u2019ve had sort of a non-linear career path, but ended up switching to the corporate world. to make a long story short, my liberal arts degree and time doing non-profit work gave me a lot of skills that enable me to really excel professionally in some more niche areas. i recently started a new job as a consultant, making way more than i\u2019d ever anticipated. when i got the offer, i told tim that the pay was \u201camazing\u201d, but he didn\u2019t ask about the actual amount and i didn\u2019t want to be braggy about it, especially since i was fairly sure it was above his current income.\n\nwell we just put in an application for a new place, and in the process of having to submit our paystubs it\u2019s become obvious that i make roughly 30% more than he does now. i expected him to think that was cool, since he\u2019s a feminist and has always been super supportive of my career. but instead he\u2019s started to make increasingly harsh jabs about how i \u201ccheated the system\u201d to get where i am, that no english lit major makes more than a cyber security professional without cheating somehow.\n\nhis major point is that i got my first job out of nepotism, which set me up to \u201ctrample\u201d more qualified people who didn\u2019t have the same advantages. it\u2019s true that i got my first post-college job after being referred by a sorority sister, but it was for non-profit work making 22k/yr, not exactly at somebody\u2019s daddy\u2019s firm. he also points out that at my first corporate job, i snagged a big promotion after volunteering to take on starting up the company\u2019s diversity/equity/inclusion program, and i\u2019ll admit that were i a white *man*, it\u2019s highly unlikely i would have been able to be the face of the eventually high-profile diversity program. tim also notes that i was awarded a small college scholarship for being a \u201cpromising female writer\u201d, when no such scholarship existed for males.\n\nbut all that said\u2026i still don\u2019t feel like i cheated the system, and it makes me angry to listen to him \u201cjoke\u201d about it, especially since i grew up blue collar and worked fulltime while going to school fulltime to afford my degree. i reached a breaking point yesterday when he made a crack about how the new/first woman on his team is an obvious diversity hire. i told him that his jokes about women cheating the system to get ahead aren\u2019t funny or \u201cguy-talk ribbing\u201d as he says, they make him sound like an insecure little boy. he told me i was being a

couldn't accommodate her at all. there's already another team member out. i put up the schedule and was very surprised at an e-mail from lacey regarding her vacation not being scheduled. i informed her we didn't have the flexibility and that she was expected to work.\n\nwhen i went to my lunch break, i walked by lacey's desk and was surprised to see it packed. she handed me her lanyard and told

year he spend christmas with me, nathan and my inlaws and he complained that the experience was \"terrible\" because he said nathan and his family had little to no accomodation for his food choices (i'm not defending them but my inlaws are quite traditional when it comes to food and a bit ignorant to what types of foods mason eats). he also said he didn't feel as welcom as the other kids in the family and that nathan forced him to share his personal stuff like his phone so that his stepnephews could watch christmas movies.\n\n\nyesterday, during breakfast we were talking about christmas and what we were planning this year but hem out of nowhere announced that he'll be spending this christmas with his dad at a rental christmas cottage in his favorite town. i was stunned, so was nathan. i asked mason when and how he agreed to this arrangement but he pointed back to what happened last christmas and said he didn't want to basically \"have another shitty holiday and be miserable\" i told him that his dad should've come to me first but he argued that he's already okayed it and so he saw no need for my opinion. we started arguing and he started complaining about me trying to ruin the experience but in response i told him that he has already ruined christmas for me and his stepdad the minhte he agreed to this arrangement. he got up and walked away after saying that i was being \"overdramatic\". nathan just sat there and looked down.\n\n\ni had a huge argument on the phone with mason's dad and he kept giving me an attitude and laughjng and saying that i sounded pathetic. when i told him i'd have my lawyer call him, he bbackpaddeled and said he woukdn't have done this if mason didn't like it. he urged me to drop it and let mason have this experience or he'll resent me for missing it. now mason isn't speaking to me. nathan is trying to convince him to stay with us because without him, our christmas is ruined but he won't budge from the looks of it.\n\n\naita for not

is marrying a woman (28f) and my husband and i have been trying to be as involved as we can be without violating our conscience or who we are and what we believe. ever since our daughter opened up to us about her relationship, we've been staying open-minded, praying, communicating with her about it, asking questions, researching, welcoming the girlfriend into our home and getting to know her, attending online therapy with a lgbt counselor that our daughter paid for, and just overall trying to be a loving presence in our daughter's life. it's a process and my husband and i have come a long way from where we were, but sometimes we still come across these, what our therapist calls, \"blocks of resistance\" that hold us back from supporting our daughter in the way that she may want us to, in that moment.\n\nand what i really appreciate about this counselor is that she takes our situation into account as well and is willing to speak up for my husband and i. a few years ago, when our daughter wanted us to attend a gay parade with her, we were hesitant and our counselor stood by us by telling our daughter that it was \"too soon\".\n\nbut other than the gay parade, things have been pretty smooth up until now. my husband has drawn a hard line about attending the wedding. i was sort of on the fence about attending, but i decided to stick with my husband. our daughter is pissed. at our last therapy session together, a week ago, our daughter said that if we didnt come to the wedding, all the work and progress that we had made would mean nothing to her, and that she would not want us to be a part of her life.\n\nagain the counselor spoke up for us and told our daughter that everyone had their hard boundaries (boundaries that they would absolutely not cross) and that instead of making ultimatums, it would be better to consider the overall picture rather than letting one moment be the deciding factor of the relationship. [i'm paraphrasing, she said it much better, but i think i got the main point].\n\nthe counselor talked to me privately afterward and told me how her parents hadn't came to her wedding, and they eventually made up thirty years down the line, but that was thirty years of memories that they both had missed out on. yet, when she talked to her parents about it recently, they said that even as much as it had hurt them not to go, they would have made the same choice because it was just something that they strongly disapproved of. she ended by telling me that she wasn't going to tell me to go or not to go, but to really consider all the pros and cons.", "she wanted us to all dress up like pandas for my 7 month old son's first halloween. we've been together for 14 years and i've only worn a halloween costume twice. i really just dont enjoy dressing up because of how expensive the costume is vs how cheaply made it is. i'm also just not into it. but i understand she just wants to do a cute family thing so i said ok fine. i did say no first but reluctantly said yes. so we went trick or treating with my family where i joked with my dad asking where his costume was. when he said he didn't have one i said \"oh that's right because you're an adult\".  i also asked my sister and her husband sarcastically why they didn't have matching costumes. \n\ni also thought it was weird to trick or treat with a 7 month old. she wanted to bring one of those plastic jack o lantern buckets for candy and i thought it was so awkward two adults and a baby dressed up with me taking candy. \"trick or treat\" the grown adult says while pushing a stroller. that candy is obviously not for the baby. she wanted to trick or treat because she didn't get to when she was growing up. alright but she doesn't understand trick or treating. babies can dress up and go out but they don't get candy and thus can't go trick or treating. so my brother in law and my dad were making slight jokes towards me, nothing too serious and i reciprocated. she was fighting back tears from this. i feel pretty bad but also think she should've expected this after having me dress as a panda. aita", "i\u2019m a 19 year old f with six older siblings. my parents spent most of my childhood spending money they didn\u2019t have on my siblings, so by the time i hit my teenage years, i realized i was probably going to have to fend for myself financially when i turn 18. i started babysitting and doing odd jobs around my neighborhood when i was 14, and eventually got part-time jobs during the school year. \n\n\nby the time i was 16, i was working three jobs in the summer and two in addition to school. when my parents told me they couldn\u2019t pay for college, i\u2019d already earned enough (along with scholarships) to be able to put myself through college and have plenty left over. i\u2019ve continued to work during the school year, and have been able to make money during quarantine by tutoring online. \n\n\nthe issue began a few months ago, when my eldest sister (29f) got married. my parents spent 30 grand on her wedding, taking out a second mortgage to do so. to make matters worse, my dad was furloughed 6 days after the wedding. they\u2019d effectively dug themselves into a hole they couldn\u2019t get out of. \n\n\ntwo weeks ago, my mom texted me for the first time since the wedding. she didn\u2019t say hi, ask how i was, or make any small talk. she just said \u201cyour dad and i need a favor. when can we call you?\u201d \n\n\ni\u2019d expected this. none of my elder siblings are doing well financially, and they\u2019ve exhausted all other loan options, both from family and the bank. i figured they would text me, ask me to loan them a few thousand, and promise to pay it back when they could figure things out. i was absolutely willing to pitch in a few thousand, and had even considered giving them some of my tutoring jobs so they could make some extra cash. \n\n\ni was not, however, expecting them to demand i give them all the money (close to $40,000) i\u2019d made from the ages of 14-18. \n\n\nthe exact statement my mom had made was \u201cyou made that money under our roof. we were the ones who allowed you to work, so you only have it because of us anyway...we bought you food and clothes for 18 years. that money is only a fraction of what you owe us...\u201d and so on.\n\n\ni said that food, clothes, and shelter were the very minimum, it\u2019s what they signed up for when they chose to become parents, i didn\u2019t ask for any of it, etc. they responded by telling me that if it wasn\u2019t for them, i wouldn\u2019t have the life i have today. i said they were being ridiculous, and hung up. \n\n\nsince that day, both (along with two of my siblings) have continuously hounded me about giving them what is \u201crightfully theirs.\u201d my siblings, who have never been asked to give them money, are still professing that it\u2019s my job as their kid to take care of

together most of our lives and are a family. she and i were extremely close.\n\nshe developed cancer when she was 14 and was sick for about 2 years. she's since made a full recovery. during that time, my parents became understandably over-protective. they also asked a lot of me. i quit my extracurriculars so i could get a job (the money went towards her medical bills) and so i could drive her to appointments. i didn't go to dances and any fun activities i did needed to include her. i did almost all of this willingly, the exception being having to quit my high school volleyball team - i did throw a bit of a tantrum about that, but was swiftly punished. and i think having one emotional breakdown was pretty chill given the circumstances.\n\nanyhow, i go to college and meet my ex, we'll call him ben, when i'm a junior. we fall in love, blah blah blah. he and i move in together when we graduate, so we've been living together for about 3 years. we were serious until july when i walked into my bedroom and saw him fucking my sister.\n\ni broke it off, tears were shed, he moved out, etc. my sister apologized at first but then backed off. i thought she was giving me space but last week she called and asked if we could meet up. she told me that she and ben were in love and were just telling me as a courtesy before they started posting photos online. distraught,  i left her in the restaurant by herself and did not pay my portion of the bill. she later venmo'ed me asking for the money.\n\nshe told my parents who then called me to their house, telling me how disappointed in me they are for not supporting my sister's relationship with ben. they brought up the fact that because she had cancer as a teenager, she never learned proper social etiquette, and has a hard time meeting people. i don't buy this, in part because i've seen her socialize just fine and since we spent a good chunk of the time she was sick together, that would also mean that i should have bad social skills as well, by that logic. they then told me that if i don't accept my sister and ben's relationship, they may have to go no contact with me. i reminded them that i'm also their daughter and they should understand my point of view, but they are adamant that this is about me being jealous of her.\n\nfor the record: i'm not jealous of her. i'm not upset that ben picked her over me. i'm sad about the end of the relationship and do feel betrayed, but lord knows that i don't want to be with a cheater. what i'm upset about is the fact that my sister chose ben over me. that she slept with ben knowing he and i were in a long-term, committed relationship, and continues to be with him knowing how much it hurts me.\n\nnow no one in my immediate family is talking to me and i'm getting

we\u2019re not looking sometimes. it\u2019s not usually a lot; it\u2019s more so just a nuisance. so i had an idea. my friend who likes to snatch our food sometimes is muslim, and he keeps halal. our school cafeteria gives us the option to get bacon on our fries too (i love america). i wouldn\u2019t get bacon on my fries otherwise, but i would rather do that than set a precedent of my friend

you broke the promise you made to us!\" she looked red in the face and the other family started staring and some even laughed at her for the face she made. she suddenly got up from her seat and rushed into the kitchen where she had a huge meltdown so loud the next door neighbors must've heard - literally i've never heard a 60+ year old woman throw a tantrum like that. needless to say dinner went awkward and my husband and his sister were giving me looks. my husband went off on me in the car and said i lied and manipulated and humiliated and exposed his mom and said he wouldn't have let me get away with it had he known. we had an argument and he is demanding i apologize to his mom for my childish behavior and for ruining christmas dinner for the whole family.\n\naita?\n\neta so this went off unexpectedly and i thought i'd show my husband some pretty helpful comments i found here minutes ago but he got mad at me when he saw it and said i was nuts to talk about his family online. he demanded my phone so he could delete it but i refused and i went upstairs and into the bedroom. i never seen him so agitated and i didn't think he'd react like that honestly. but thank you guys for your support. it really means so much. i'll update if i can. thanks again :)", "so this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so i figured i would bring it to the group to see if i'm the asshole or not.\n\nmy boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  i absolutely hate it because i am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.\n\nfor an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  we live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  we were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.\n\na few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, i told my boyfriend that the event started at noon, not 1:00.  and just as i figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  we show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.\n\nso last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  i had lied about what time the event started.  i know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if i can lie about something like that, whose to say what else i'd be lying about.  i told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that i don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if i'm 'hiding something'.  i explained that i only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  in my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.\n\nhe doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one i lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).\n\ni've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but i just have to know if i'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.", "i'm (26f) recently divorced after learning my sister (27f) and husband were having an affair. i cut my sister off the day i found out. we have not spoken since, we have not been in the same room for more than ten seconds and i will not have a relationship with her moving forward. this year has been rough and covid made some things easier regarding there was no visiting family so the pressure was gone. but recently my mom wanted to have a family dinner again and i told her i would not go because i did not want to be in my sisters presence. she told me i can't avoid her forever, she's my sister and we share family. i told her i can and i will. her response was telling me i am being unfair making her choose between us and i said i'm not making her choose because i'm fine not being invited, i know my stance means i will end up being excluded. but i will not play nice with her and my ex. especially now that they are getting married too. we're never going to play happy families. i don't want to be civil to them. so i would rather not have anything to do with them. and they will never have anything to do with me

had bought a ps5 as a gift for himself, but the thing is he used *my* money to do so without my permission using a portion of my emergency savings that he had access to in case of you know, an emergency. which i do not believe being able to get your hands on a new video game console classes as.\n\nthis led to a huge argument and i took the console away and reboxed it up, i debated on returning it to the shop for the money but i know my  sister has been struggling to find one for my 13 year old nephew for over a year, so instead i wrapped it up and took it round to hers and put it under the tree and quietly explained what it was and what had happened, my sister then gave me the money for it. \n\nmy husband went *ballistic* shouting and demanding i go get it back which i of course refused to do, telling him as it had been bought with my money it was my choice what happened to it. he is now sulking and refusing to talk to me and acting like a huge child.", "\nto start i want to mention that unlike my wife i have a very good relationship with mom. and because my siblings can always afford pricy gifts for mom this year i decided to gift her something nice and expensive for once on christmas though i'm currently unemployed but i work for the past few months and my wife and i have a joint account.\n\n\nthe problem began when my wife found out i purchased a $600 dollar necklace for my mom to gift her on christmas using our joint account- she went off on me saying i should've told her and shouldn't have taken money from our joint account that she uses to pay the bills and rent especially now that were struggling. i asked why should i tell her since it's for us both but she reminded me that despite that being true (1. i no longer work and (2. 600 is a lot and i should've consulted her but the reasons i didn't are (1. i feel that it's my money too and i can make purchases using our joint account and (2. i know if i told my wife she'd refuse to let my buy the gift solely because she hates my mom. she yelled at me saying that is her hard earn money i threw away and needed to return the necklace but i refused because mom already knows about it. she responded that this is no longer our joint account since i no longer earn money and that if i want to gift mom expensive items then needed to earn money. she insisted i return it but i said no and it escelated to me calling her bitter and control after she pointed out i never got her anything in this price range.\n\n\nshe's insisting i return it and at least get a cheaper one but i'm done being the one with the least expensive/valubale gifts to gift in the family. she is making this her hill to die on. aita?", "my wife and i are from the uk, but fairly  recently visited disney with our 5

i'm 22.\n\nso, in my apartment, since it's an old house that was originally a single family house, there isn't much soundproofing. and the floors creak when people move. \n\ni've gotten used to the sound of the guy upstairs getting up at 4 am since he starts work at 5.\n\nand the sound of the girls in the apartments to either side of mine watching telenovelas till midnight, taking work calls all day and having friends over on weekend nights. \n\ni know when i play music or have friends over, some of the sound leaks through the walls. so i'd never get upset about hearing my neighbors because it goes both ways. \n\nso... when my boyfriend started coming over more often, he had complaints about the neighbors. which put me in an awkward place, he wanted to go speak to them or have me text them and i said no. \n\nfor example, one of the early times he stayed over we went to bed around 10. he wanted me to ask my neighbor to turn down her tv. i said she didn't have it that loud and she turns it off at midnight anyway. \n\nat 4 am, he got very irritated with my upstairs neighbor getting up and cooking breakfast. i said that he would be done by 5 because that's when his shift starts. \n\nat 7 am, he was still trying to sleep in and the neighbor on the other side had some work calls that he said he couldn't sleep through. i offered him earplugs and he said he couldn't sleep with them in either, he wanted me to ask her to quiet down.\n\nhe had similar comments every time he heard someone else in the building just living their life especially if it was when he was in bed. \n\ni got frustrated with my boyfriend and told him \"you know, you can't expect to date a 'hot young' 22 year old and not wanna deal with a 22 year olds living situation! i don't know if you realize but this is a normal apartment for someone my age... hell, my neighbors are pretty great; nobody's throwing loud parties on work nights, nobody's having screaming fights, nobody's having babies!\" \n\n(the 'hot young' part was in sarcastic air quotes because those were his words not mine)\n\nhe got irritated and asked why i was bringing age into it, and i said it's because he can't both want someone so young and also want someone with house kinda money! and he was being so out of touch with how normal people in their 20s live.\n\nhe got really irritated with me bringing age into it, and even more annoyed when i'd respond to his neighbor complaints in the future with \"ok boomer\" or tell him that if he wanted me to have a \"rich person apartment\" he could pay for it. \n\naita for

arrangements yesterday, and my brother and parents just kind of assumed that i wouldn't mind sharing a room with my nieces, whilst my brother and his wife and my parents get their own rooms.\n\ni said i didn't want to share a room with them, and said that they should be sleeping in my brother and sil's room since they're their parents. my parents called me dramatic and said that it's not a big deal, and said that my nieces won't give me any trouble. i told them i don't care. they said i'm being a bad aunt and told me to grow up.\n\ni told them if i don't get my own room i'll cancel my ticket, which would result in everyone else having to pay more or find someone else to go in my place because we got a group discount with the resort.\n\nmy brother said i'm a whiny asshole and

relationship with my mom or stepdad. i\u2019m angry at them because 2 years ago when my dad passed away he left me inheritance that i\u2019m supposed to get on my 18th bday. i\u2019m also getting survivors benefits that my mom uses for me when i need things so is not like she used this inheritance  for me. \n\nthey bought a house that we moved into. it was weird for me because we always lived in a 3 bedroom apartment. my stepdad is a substitute teacher and my mom\u2019s a part time reception.  they never even had enough to go for a vacation or something but all of a sudden they had for a large house out of nowhere. mg mom looked guilty about it until she finally admitted they used some of what my dad left me to buy the house. i lost my shit. \n\nthey tried to justify that it was for me too and i asked them does that mean they\u2019re moving out when i\u2019m 18 an the house is gone be in my name? and they\u2019re like no. that\u2019s what i thought. supposedly the house was for my but max time i would\u2019ve lived there was a few months. \n\nthere\u2019s still some money left if i went to a cheap college but still can\u2019t believe they used my money for something on themselves. that amount could\u2019ve helped me get my own damm house. also think is funny since my stepdad didn\u2019t like my dad because since i was spending more time with him that meant my mom had to pay a little in child support. \n\nbut he doesn\u2019t care using the money he left for me. sorry if this a bit of a rant but where i\u2019m asking it i was an asshole was last saturday his family all came to stay at the house. they stayed friday night so it was nxt morning when i\u2019m getting ready to go to work. i made myself eggs in a hurry before i left my stepdad asked how come there wasn\u2019t more for his family. and told him it\u2019s because i\u2019m already leaving for work there wasn\u2019t gonna be time to make something for everyone. he acted like it\u2019s not a big deal if i\u2019m a little late since its rare they have people over at the house. \n\nwe got back in forth because i\u2019m not going to stop to make breakfast whne he can do it himself. then he pulled that don\u2019t talk to me like that in my house. btw there\u2019s no door in the kitchen and that leads right to the living room so they could hear all this. i said loudly actually it\u2019s *my* house since you paid for it with my money and don\u2019t forget they stole from me. \n\nmy mom is expecting me to apologize for embarrassing him in front of his whole family because after i left they all had shit to say about it. they already went home by the time i got home but you could feel the tension. he straight up ignored me that\u2019s how bad it was. i don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything for me to apologize for so that\u2019s where she thinks i\u2019m not being a good son and kind of an a-hole. wanna know if others feel the same.", "my daughter, who we\u2019ll call lucy, has been having behavioral problems since her mom and i divorced when she was 7. the divorce was really hard on lucy, but what made it even worse is that her mom took a job overseas soon after. now, lucy sees her mom like once a year and talks to her on the phone maybe once every few months.\n\nadding onto this, i got remarried when she was 10. at first, lucy was excited to have a \u201cnew mom\u201d. but my new wife and i had kids, and it pushed her acting out to the extreme. instead of just talking back, she was smoking weed, skipping class and just hanging out in the bathroom, dating high school guys when she was in middle school, etc. she has been to therapy and on medication, and she has definitely mellowed down, but she still can be extremely difficult to deal with.\n\na few days ago, lucy sat my wife and i down and told us she was pregnant, and she was having her baby. she had been hiding the pregnancy for months, thinking if she could hide it for 16 weeks we couldn\u2019t make her get an abortion (this is false information, our state still allows her to get an abortion at this point in time). she basically told us she is keeping and raising the baby, and that the father won\u2019t be involved.\n\ni was livid. i told her to either abort, or put the baby up for adoption. lucy refused, and asked me to support her through this. she said she wanted to own up to her mistake, not just abandon her child.\n\ni know lucy. she is barely responsible for herself, much less another life. and she has implied she expects my wife, who is a full-time mom, to parent her kid so she can continue to enjoy her own. maybe if my two kids were older,\u00a0it\u2019d be easier, but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to add this responsibility to my wife who has two toddlers to worry about.\n\ni\u2019m disappointed in lucy for lying, and for not thinking this through. i have tried to be on her side because of all she\u2019s been through, but i think she\u2019s going to never learn her lesson and continue to make a mess of her life. i think the best option might be to kick her out and give her a taste of reality so she can get a taste of reality. would this make me an asshole?\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\n**edit**: so seeming as i'm irrevocably the asshole, what might y'all suggest i do? i didn't sign up to raise another child and i don't have the financial means to support her. lucy can't even take care of herself, much less a newborn. i feel like i'm being looked at as this \"villain\", but i genuinely think that people don't understand the frustration of having a very troubled kid whose now pregnant and plans to keep the baby and expects me to pay for it. not to mention the local laws that state that i'm financially responsible until she turns 18. i didn't sign up for a child, and i'm not raising her kid because she refuses to look at this objectively.", "i(36m) am married to a wonderful woman(34). when we first got married 8 years ago, i was

with \"funny you say that, i am a bottom.

behaving in a bad manner constantly commenting on other people's looks, belongings, calling them stuff that isn't cool and just being  insensitive. it's like she lost a filter or something because usually she's polite but my wife suspected that our daughter's sudden misbehavior occurred after she started hanging out with new girls from the school. basically the mean type and have picked on their behavior. i've sat with my daughter and had many discussions about how her behavior has been negatively affecting everyone around her. our housemaid is the person most affected here and my daughter has chosen her to be her target for hair, clothes, \"etiquette\" criticism. she has complained about our daughter calling her offensive names like filthy and gross for cleaning certain areas in our house. i took a stand and explicitly told my daughter i'd punish her if she ever said stuff like that to our housemaid again.\n\n\nlast week my daughter had a party to go to, earlier that day she called our housemaid \"filthy\" so i grounded her by not letting her go to the party. she threw a fit and called our housemaid a liar saying she never called her that. that was the end of it.\n\ndays later my daughter came to me saying she couldn't find her iphone after looking everywhere. she asked me to call her number and i did. my wife and i were stunned to discover that the iphone was ringing inside our housemaid's bag. i had an confrontation with her immediately and she denied and cried saying she never touched the phone nor had any idea how it got there. i noticed my daughter calling her theif repeatedly so i told her to stop and go to her room. i checked the indoor camera before continuing the argument and saw my daughter place her iphone inside our housemaid's bag, i was livid. i apologized to the housemaid and gave her the rest of the day off. i then showed the video to my daughter and she was absolutely speechless. i said what she did was immoral and straight up offensive to tamper with that poor woman's livelihood over a petty party she couldn't go to. i told her she was grounded and will have to spend the night in the backyard (she is a germaphobe) but she cried begging me to not make her sleep with the dirt, insects and hot temp. i refused to discuss it or i'd make it 2 nights. my wife said i should go easy on her but i said calling people filthy and accusing them of stealing wasn't ok in fact it was the absolute worst, i then went through with my punishment. \n\n\n**the reason i chose this punishment was because of the fact that my daughter says she is a germaphobe and use this as excuse to insult others hygiene and appearance, our backyard has dirt and bugs in it and this kind of things get her uncomfortable but other than that the backyard is 100% safe**\n\n\n\n\n\n**question/ why doesn't she clean up and do house chores as punishment instead?**.\n\n\n**because i've already tried this punishment before and it didn't work because she

maintenance supervisor. about a year ago they hired tabitha\\* to work in their accounting department. since the day she first started working there, she has had an infatuation with my husband that is now becoming unprofessional and inappropriate.\n\nthis started when the heat went out in her office. my husband's job as supervisor is to assign tasks to his employees, however, she is never satisfied with the work they do, even though he says that they do great work, so she demands he work on her office. she constantly calls him on his work phone for mundane things (carpet is loose in a corner, loose screw on her coat hook) and he goes and fixes them without issue. \n\nlast year when we went to the company christmas party (pre-plague times) she was very flirty with him, constantly grabbed his hand. when he introduced us she just grinned at my and said \"look there's peter,\" and grabbed his hand and walked away. when we sat at the table she damn near pushed me out of my seat to sit next to him, and my husband told her to get up that it was my seat. she walked off in a huff, and when she saw me in the restroom she shoved past me. i told my husband what happened and he said it was fine, that she was harmless. i told him that she was not fine, and that she clearly had feelings for him and she was acting like a jealous girlfriend. \n\nthe past few weeks this has ramped up to an astonishing level of inappropriate. she recently moved into a new house and my husband and some of the other guys from work helped her move and put things together. he gave her his personal cell phone number, and she has been calling and texting non-stop about things she needs help with. multiple times a day at all hours of the day and night she will call and text him for help. last night at 2:00am she called about her heat not working right. my husband said he would go over and look at it after work. i broke down. i told him he was not going, that she could call a technician like everyone else, and that he is not her personal maintenance man. \n\ni told him very clearly that she has feelings for him and he is so dense he can't see it. i told him that while it is nice to help on occasion, she calls him all the time asking for help with things that she can do on her own (move boxes/furniture) or pay to have a repair person come and fix. i told him that once he gave out his personal phone number that he crossed a line, and i am not comfortable with it. \n\nhe said that this will most likely be an easy fix and it won't take long, so i cried and told him that he can either to be married

flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. \n\nabout six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years [21m]. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on \"proper\" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. \n\nso the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's \"starting to get annoying\". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there \"skulking around all the time\". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's \"getting ridiculous\". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.\n\nmy potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and

decent house in a fine neighborhood. i had a slightly lower paying job.  almost a year and a half ago, his job had to cut some employees and he was one of them. he had to take on a job and he earned much less than he had before. \n\ni moved into their house 5 months ago. since i moved in i have helped a lot with the bills, usually half or more of them. \n\nyesterday was my birthday. i wanted to celebrate at a nice restaurant near us, however it was closed. there was another one a little closer to us, although it was more expensive. i suggested going there for my birthday to alex, and he said that he couldn't afford to pay for dinner there and if we went we would need to split the bill. i was a little upset but he said he would make something himself. \n\nthe cake i wanted was, admittedly, somewhat expensive. i pointed it out to him, and he said again that he didn't think he could afford it with christmas coming up and we'd have to go half. i told him i wasn't paying for a cake for my own birthday, and he said he'd see what he could do. \n\nwell, yesterday came. he made dinner, and it was quite good, better than most meals we eat, although not as good as what it would be at a restaurant. however, when he brought the cake out it was just something he had made himself. \n\nhe said he was sorry he couldn't afford the nicer cake but he had made this one and his daughter had helped. \n\ni pretended to enjoy it but after i told him that i was hoping for a slightly nicer cake. he said he had tried his best and he couldn't spend the money he had set aside for bills on a cake. \n\ni guess his daughter heard because now he's also saying that i made her upset after she helped make it. \n\nhe keeps saying i should apologize to her and say that i really liked it.

condition and the side affects his medication have on him.\n\nmy parents have always struggled with money because of medical bills and unfortunately they can not afford to buy my brother nice things for example he always wanted a console to play with. he only gets to play when my uncle and cousins bisits and bring their console. my brother has been feeling sad and lonely recently after his doctors recommended that visits be limited. i decided to use my salary to get him his own console and wait til christmas to give it to him. i bought an xbox and has been sitting in my close til i discovered that my fiance took it and sent it to his nephew who lives states away. i was in dismay i confronted him about it asking why he took the xbox knowing it was supposed to be a gift for my brother and he said he knew but explained his sister's single mom and couldn't buy any gifts for her son nor are they recieving gifts from family since they're all ignoring her after giving her money so the think they've done enough. he told me he felt sorry for his nephew and wanted to cheer him up but didn't have money so he thought that he could send him the xbox then we'll fingure out what i'm going to gift my brother together. i told him he had no right to touch the xbox and said that what he did was theft which made him upset and somewhat shocked. he said he was very hurt i essentially called him a thief when he thought that i cared about our nephew as much and he does and explained my brother does not need the xbox since he can't find time to play due to his condition and also not finding playmates also due to his condition. i told him my brother is still capable and he was making it seem as if he wasn't but he argued he didn't mean it this way, just that he was hurt i called his good deed \"theft\" but i stood by what i said and demanded he either pay for the xbox or pay me but he acted more hurt calling me callous and mean to take a gift from a child like that but i said i didn't gift his nephew this device and so it is not my problem.\n\nhe gave me complete silence and then went to stay at a hotel for 3 days saying i was being unfair to him and hurt him deeply. the

that she would push herself to the limit to keep up with me fitness wise. \n\nhowever after our 4 year old and 3 year old girls were born my fianc\u00e9e began saying that using the elliptical and

my fianc\u00e9e and said it was one thing to not feel like a woman but to essentially blame our kids for ruining her body when she made that decision as an adult with free will was horrible mothering.

brother who\u2019s married with 4 kids (ages 2-12, only youngest 2 are his) and a much younger brother (23) who\u2019s single. my wife and i offered to host a weekend get together. \n\nmy older brother had to work late the first night, but his wife emily (fake name) offered to come earlier in the day with the kids and cook dinner for everyone. emily is a great cook and her parents own a local restaurant that\u2019s well known for a dish they serve once a month. emily is the chef for that dish and my wife and i have had it  but my mom and brother haven\u2019t tried it. i asked emily when she arrived that day if she would make the dish and she agreed. i had most of what she needed but i told her to text my younger brother for any extra items and i would pay for them. \n\ndinner went great, food was wonderful. but at some point, my mom took a picture of her plate and sent it to my older brother with a caption that said something like \u201cyou\u2019re missing out!\u201d  and then it all went to shit. \n\nthe reason emily only makes this dish once a month at the restaurant is because she\u2019s highly allergic to one of the main ingredients. her parents are weirdly protective of the recipe and won\u2019t let anyone else cook it. i assumed this was common knowledge within my family but she and my brother have only been together about 5 years, so maybe it hasn\u2019t come up. \n\nin any case, my brother was furious that i asked her to make it. my little brother said i was \u201cdisgusting\u201d and my mom dramatically claimed that i put her in \u201cdanger.\u201d  frankly, i think the reaction was ridiculous. she\u2019s a grown woman and clearly knows how to manage her allergy. it\u2019s not like she ate it. also, emily didn\u2019t seem upset about anything and was off watching a movie with all the kids so didn\u2019t hear any of this. \n\ni kind of thought it had blown over after a couple hours, until my older brother got there around midnight and found emily in the kitchen eating some cereal. he told me it was \u201cbullshit\u201d that i made her cook a meal she can\u2019t eat and then let her eat cereal. again, this woman is a grown up. she could have asked my little brother to get her something else to cook for herself but she didn\u2019t. \n\nat that point, i was tired. my wife had cleaned the kitchen and emily had gotten the kids in bed. so when my older brother pulled out a chicken breast saying he was going to cook something for emily, i put my foot down and said no. i feel like my family babies emily as it is (lots of reasons for this, i understand it but it\u2019s frustrating) and i wasn\u2019t willing to let my brother make another mess cooking a whole other meal at 12 am. \n\nthe whole rest of the weekend was awkward and strained and basically ended with my mom and younger brother telling me that i ruined the whole get together. \n\ndo i not get to set boundaries in my own house??\n\n*edit

gets it isn't her business and she would never say anything, but she has confided to me that she hates it. for the bridal shower most of the women wore sundresses. tiffany wore something which looked to me like a ruffly crop top and a matching skirt. i thought it looked fine. she did mention she was leaving early because she had plans.\n\nduring the shower melissa realized that what tiffany was wearing was actually a bikini, because the skirt was pretty see through and she could make out the bottoms. she asked her, but tried to laugh it off, and tiffany admitted it was a bikini, because she was going out on my dad's boat after and wouldn't have time to change.\n\nmy future mil asked tiffany if she found it a bit weird. tiffany said no, she thought it passed as a crop top. melissa and her

annoyed because my mom was trying to make it into a much bigger issue and act like i shouldn't marry melissa over it, which i promptly shut down.\n\nby the time i talked to melissa she was heated and calling tiffany and attention whore and a show off. she asked if my mom had said anything, because i guess my mom was rolling her eyes at her at the shower. i told her i talked to my mom and told her to shut up. melissa than asked me if i hated tiffany. i said that i don't hate her, and then i said to be honest i think her outfit was fine. it just looked like a crop top, and if that ruined the day for melissa, that is something melissa needs to work on. \n\nthat upset melissa and she feels that i was brushing her feelings aside. she said i should talk to my dad, and i told her i wasn't going to

sounds horrible, but hear me out.\n\nmy sil used to be a drug addict, with no stable job and trapped in toxic relationships, till she got pregnant 2 years ago, but ended up miscarrying cause of her unhinged behaviour, which left her a mark on her. since then she turned her life around, accepted to get help for her addiction and she's clean and has a stable income.  \n\nhowever, there's still one problem with her : she still mourns her lost pregnancy almost everytime we see her, which i understood initially, as it would be a pretty big trauma for everyone, but it's been years since then and her pity parties already got pretty old, especially ( and i know i might sound cynical ) when her lost pregnancy was what made her turn her life around for the better.\n\nfast forward, i (28f) got pregnant with my husband of 3 years (29m) and yesterday we made a gender reveal party for our families ( it's a boy btw ). his sister was of course there and not long after the reveal she started to reminiscence about much she'd wanted to become a mother as well and how much she got affected by her pregnancy. i quickly got sick of this, as not only she was once again pulling this stunt, but she was doing at my gender reveal in order to get all the attention on her.\n\nand so i told her that she should reconsider her miscarriage as a blessing in disguise, as it finally gave her the help she needed to turn her life around. she looked shocked at me and then asked me if i seriously think that her miscarriage was a good thing. i told her that considering that back then she was a drug addict who was changing her jobs and partners faster than sockets, with a father who wasn't in the picture ( at least that's what she told us, but knowing her past lifestyle i wouldn't be surprised if she didn't even know who the father was and was too embarrassed to tell us ), it's probably for the better that her child wasn't brought into the world in these conditions. after that she, together with my parents-in-law, started blowing off at me, telling me that just because i lack empathy doesn't mean i get to reduce her trauma to a good thing.\n\nmy husband intervened and finally managed to calm them down and the party ended abruptly. after everyone left, my husband took aside and told me that what i said was really out of line and my pregnancy hormones aren't an excuse to act so unhinged. that made me blew off at me, telling him to cut the misogynistic crap about pregnant women being out of control, as there was nothing unhinged about what i said to his sister, it was just the rational truth and if he wants to see unhinged behaviour, he should look no further than his own family. \n\nhe got too ashamed to say anything else after that and i made him sleep on the couch, so i wouldn't

complaining about me randomly walking into her room but i go in there looking for the stuff i asked for. she gave me a hard time just because i walked in on thomas half naked to get the eye shadow i borrowed from her. and then that other time when i walked in late at night. she told me i nedded to get her permission to enter the room before i take anything but i figured this would make things complicated. it's enough that i have to ask to borrow an item.\n\n\nso, last night at around 10pm i went upstairs and into her bedroom to grab the hair dryer. i walked it and woops, i saw them in an intimate position together in bed. i had no idea they're were doing it, especially since claire told me that thomas has been feeling sick the past 2 days. she lashed out at me yelling that i get out. i quickly grabbed the hair dryer then walked out and shut the door.\n\n\nminutes later, she came downstairs in her robe and went off on me saying she was done with me repeatedly disrespecting and violating hers and her husband's privacy. i told her it was cool, no big deal. and that i needed the dryer but didn't have time to ask for permissin. she got even louder saying i had no business barging into her marital space and embarrassing her and her husband like this. i told her that i was sorry but she really overreacted to this whole thing. this made her more pissed she went on about how i'm living here rent free and yet not being respectable enough. i stopped arguing and went to my room.\n\n\nthis morning, thomas left the house early amd claire ignored me on breakfast. still upset saying i don't get to say wether she overreacted or not and that my behavior was inappropriate. she even wants me to apologize to her husband for making last night \"awkward\".", "my brother is a very hardworking man and at 27 he is now very wealthy and doing well for himself. he\u2019s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair,

because her and my brother broke up. i asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of \u201cauditioning\u201d to prove she was with him for the right reasons. she went on to say that my brother is paranoid she\u2019s after his money so he would test her like 1. leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she\u2019s not going out with him for money 3. never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn\u2019t. \n\n\n\ni was shocked so i had to hear my brothers perspective. we spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there\u2019s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. he said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. i asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could\u2019ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. he said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn\u2019t bought her a single gift since they\u2019ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. \n\n\nhe confronted her and said he thinks she\u2019s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. he\u2019s upset about the \u201cgold digging bitch\u201d and when i laughed he called me an asshole. he said i would never understand what\u2019s it\u2019s like being a rich man and being used and i get that concern, but i told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he\u2019s delusional as hell. if he doesn\u2019t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone

he\u2019s my dad\u2019s father, but my dad hardly had a relationship with him. i have two other siblings (one younger, (13) and one older (26). my grandma divorced my grandpa when my dad was only 10, so he lived with my grandma his whole life in a different state and didn\u2019t see him. \n\nwhen he got older he saw him a little more and my grandpa started coming around a little bit more as well. he\u2019d stay for a week at a time and then go home. he was an old, bitter man to be honest. he never got remarried and lived his whole life in his coastal town with the same friends he\u2019d had his whole life. \n\nhe wasn\u2019t pleasant to be around and could hold grudges longer than anyone i\u2019ve ever met. but regardless of this, he was filthy rich. he owned a successful business that he sold for $1m dollars. he retired after selling, but his house sits on an island as well as the biggest piece of land on the island. so it sold for well over $3m. \n\ni was never close with my grandpa, but i took after his sister who is an rn and he adores her. he always told me that he was proud to see me follow in her footsteps. \n\nhe died a few months ago. since then, my family has been torn apart. he left everything to me. he essentially liquidated all of his assets and it ended up being close to 8 million dollars. i was shocked. i didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t know what to do with the money, but i\u2019m going to save it. \n\nmy dad and stepmom as well as my siblings are hounding me to split the money with them. i just can\u2019t do it. \n\nmy dad is an alcoholic who never said anything nice about his dad. despite him being bitter, my grandpa actually bought my dad a $300,000 house. my dad would 100% drink away any money given to him. \n\nas far as my siblings, my brother has full financial support from my grandma as he is the favorite and he\u2019s very wasteful and ungrateful. he never talks to me and always is very mean to me when he does. \n\nmy little

them all a chunk of the money. i don\u2019t know what to do and i\u2019m buckling under pressure here. i\u2019ve already had 2 police officers out to my house because my dad is claiming i stole the

married for 3 years, and we've been trying for a baby for almost all that time. it hasn't been an easy journey in the least, with no results. i had a miscarriage last year which broke my heart. nevertheless, me and will are trying to come to terms with everything and continue with our lives, but it's difficult. we thankfully have a lot of support from family which helps.\n\nsome background on my sister jane (29f). jane is nice and kind, but she does tend to pick arguments and gets emotional pretty easily, and doesn't really interact with our family a whole lot. she's the type of person that has everything but acts like she has nothing - like she has a successful career, good friends, she's beautiful etc., but she said that she feels meaningless and \"unsupported\" sometimes. again jane is wonderful, but she tries to act like the \"not like other girls\" sometimes. also another thing about her, she has said multiple times before she doesn't care about having kids. like she would play with our little cousins and likes kids in general, but doesn't want any of her own, which is fine because that's her choice.\n\na few days ago i met up with jane for lunch (i haven't physically seen her in a few months but we texted), she looked like she'd gained a bit of weight but i assumed it was from work stress or something. she then dropped the tidbit that she was 5 months along. i was shocked, mainly because i didn't know she was in a serious relationship and she never mentioned pregnancy when we talked.  she said that she slept with a guy she met at a club a couple times. again this was pretty shocking news to me (and jane was never the type for one night stands and stuff), i asked her if our parents knew and she said no. i asked what her plan was now, she said that she's looking forward to becoming a mom. this sort of felt like a punch in the gut, that me and my husband have been trying for so long to have a baby and my sister, who never wanted kids in the first place is having one whoring around. i said to jane i thought she said she didn't care to have kids, but jane said that she feels \"different\" now and this baby is a \"blessing\". i got kind of tired of this, so i told her that she knows full well about mine and will's struggles, and she's acting like she's going to play happy families with some random's baby. i realized what i said was kind of harsh and said sorry, but jane got really upset and ended up leaving. i did try and call/text her back but she hasn't replied. i think she's overreacting and i did apologize, but aita?", "so, right now i'm

couple. we dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. i won't lie, i loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. she, however, seemed super worried. i sat down and talked with her about it. i told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.\n\nthese past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.\n\nsuffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not said a single word to her. i have pretty much told her that i want her out of my life. i also demanded a dna test the minute the child is born. if it is mine, i'll help her support it. if not, then i am never seeing her again.\n\ni've been cold to her. her and her parents has tried multiple times to \"work it out\" with me but i've refused any contact with them. at one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and i kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. any time she's tried to \"reconcile\" i've shut it down,\n\nmy friends are saying i'm in wrong here. according to them she's pregnant and because of that i should at

hubby, for his part, is a thrasher. bruce lee would be jealous of the moves he pulls off while unconscious. it's a constant war between us when we fall asleep, and both of us often wake up sore and exhausted. it was starting to affect our relationship. neither of us wanted to move to a separate bed because we like spending our nights together, but it seemed like an inevitability. we were both crabby every morning, and we started fighting as soon as we got up. it sucked, but neither of us wanted to concede defeat and move to the other bed.\n\nquick background: i was a huge nerd as a teenager. full on otaku (go ahead, cringe, i do too). one night as a joke, i brought down an old anime body pillow from the attic (i know, the cringe) and plopped it down between my husband and i, declaring it our demilitarized zone. hubby also thought it was hilarious, and we named her dmz-chan. she stayed there the whole night.\n\nit was a game changer. dmz-chan protected me from hubby's rem-induced rampages, and she's just heavy enough that i can't yank the blankets at full speed. dmz-chan is now a beloved part of our nightly routine. we both thought it was the funniest thing, but she legitimately helped us solve the only real issue in our marriage.\n\none day, mil stopped by to pick something up. she got up to use the restroom, passing by our open bedroom door. you can guess what she saw. dmz-chan, propped up in the middle of our bed, her giant soulful anime eyes looking right back at mil. when she got back, she quickly grabbed her stuff and left, hubby and i both confused. she later mentioned dmz-chan to hubby while they were on the phone, and it absolutely mortified him. as far as i know, mil now thinks we're deviants in a three-way relationship with a body pillow. hubby was too embarrassed to explain, and now he wants to put dmz-chan back in the attic.\n\ni was upset. i told him i didn't want to go back to boxing each other at night, and that dmz-chan helped us so much in that. he agreed, but suggested we get a normal, plain body pillow case to replace her. i felt like there was no need to spend money on something we already have, and if it really was that big of an issue, we can put her in the closet while we have company over. hubby is firm in that she has to go permanently. i know he's embarrassed, but i feel we shouldn't have to compromise

back (i\u2019m right handed, if that matters). anyway, i\u2019ve been struggling to find a job after college and finally landed an interview for a desk job. based on the job description, it seems like the job involves a lot of clerical work on the computer (creating spreadsheets, sending emails, etc.). i am proficient at using a computer but of course, it\u2019s a bit more difficult without a second hand. i don\u2019t really use a prosthetic because it\u2019s uncomfortable and i can\u2019t really type with it anyway.\n\nfast forward to the interview, i decide to put on my prosthetic that i rarely use and i put it in an arm sling. i also wrap it up like it\u2019s broken. with the fingers part, i kind of kept it tucked under my blazer. basically, it just looked like i had an injured arm. one of the interviewers looked at my arm and something like \u201chow\u2019s your arm?\u201d and i replied with a slight joke \u201c\u2018\u2018tis but a flesh wound.\u201d the interviewer laughed and asked if i needed any accommodations before we start. i said no and we began the interview. it went really well and i was called for a second interview the next week.\n\ni told my friends about this and they all more or less said i\u2019m an asshole for lying about my disability. my thought process was that a company shouldn\u2019t be biased in hiring people based on their disabilities anyway, and i\u2019m confident i can do my job well (albeit i could do much better with two hands), so i don\u2019t think i did anything wrong. aita?", "\n\n\n\ni got invited to my fiance's family christmas celebratory dinner. it's my first christmas with them. i have always been picky about what i eat. can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. before accepting their invite i let fmil know that i wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. she refused and told me to bring my own dish. i said if i had to bring my own dish when i'm a guest then i better stay at home then. we went back and forth and i insisted i wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. i just thought it was a simple request and fmil could've agreed if she really wanted me there. my fiance agreed that i shhould bring my own dish but i didn't.\n\n\nwhen we arrived there and i saw that no accommodations were made i got up, go my things and walked out and went home. my fmil and fiance were shocked. i got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. how is it my responsibilty to feed myself when i'm a guest? makes no sense to me. i told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.\n\n\n\nnow he's continuelly saying i fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake.\n\n\neta to clear few points:\n\n\n* for those saying i have no respect for my inlaws. i do, especially fmil. i respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had.\n\n\n* i work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook.\n\n\n* i wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes. just one simple option.", "\n\ncontext: my husband (m34) and i (f26) got married 9 months ago, we live in a different town from his parents, and his mom visited us unexpectedly on friday. \n\nnow to give some context about my mil, she is okay-ish but has no respect for her son's privacy and by extension, mine. \n\nwhen it was time to go to bed, mil requested that we let her sleep in the bedroom, on the master bed, not just that but lock the door as well because she explained she can't feel comfortable enough to sleep without locking the door. i found this bizzare but i politely declined and suggeted other options like the guest room, couch and air mattress but no she turned around and presented these options to me. my husband agreed but i said no. this initiated an argument between her and i.\u00a0during the argument i pointed put how i didn't want to be keot out of my room and away from my stuff but she lashed out at my husband saying \"don't you just stand there! say something!\". my husband told me to let her it's just one night, but i told her those were all the options i had for her and if she didn't like them then i could book her in a hotel. she took it as in i was kicking her out and started crying which made my husband upset. \n\nshe left at 12am and my husband blew up saying i disrespected his mom who was a guest at our house and treated her poorly, he then reminded me it's our bedroom not just mine and i acted horribly to her causing her to go stay at a hotel in the middle of the night. he went to book a room in the same hotel as her and turned his phone off. the next day she went home and told the family who berated me calling my behavior towards mil abhorrent and loathsome, now my husband is complaining about how i keep trying to ruin his relationship with his family and push them away. \n\nbut i want to know if i was really ta?", "i have a friend, bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. he\u2019s quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he\u2019s a solid guy and he\u2019s good to spend time with. we met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. first year we lived together, and have stayed friends since i moved out. after the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. he\u2019s not completely without his sight so it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it\u2019s just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he\u2019s not allowed to drive or get his license. he\u2019s completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can\u2019t drive. he\u2019s always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he\u2019d travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.\n\n\nnow my fianc\u00e9 and i have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. as is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and bobby received both. because i\u2019m not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. we had a few people who missed the rsvp date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. the rsvp date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. \n\n\nbackground backgrounded. now for the potential assholery.\n\n\nbobby also missed the rsvp date. he wasn\u2019t the only one i had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he\u2019s messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. the reason for his plus one is his eyesight. because he doesn\u2019t drive and he\u2019s not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. i flat out told him no, he\u2019s not inviting his mum as a plus one because we\u2019ve already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she\u2019s welcome at the rest of the day. \nthe hotel in reality doesn\u2019t need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there\u2019s no easy space to slot her in, and i don\u2019t want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. i now doubt whether he\u2019ll come, because i don\u2019t know if she\u2019s happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.\n\n\nam i the asshole?\n\n\n\n\n*", "my wife (36) and i (37m) have 2 kids, a daughter (8) and a son (3). my wife is an essential worker as she\u2019s a doctor. she works extremely long hours with hardly any days off whilst i work a typical 9-5 job so i\u2019ve always taken care of arranging the kids for school and care etc.\n\nwell with lockdown, i\u2019ve been able to homeschool my daughter but since my wife is an essential worker, my sons nursery has still been able to take him in so i have dropped him off there as normal as even though i\u2019m homeschooling my other kid, i\u2019m fitting that around me working from home. it makes it easier for my son to still have his routine and so i can do my work and so on.\n\nanyway, i was going to pick him up like normal but my wife chose to do it as she was off at that time and could actually get him. the people at this nursery know my wife as do the parents even though she\u2019s rarely there. she was actually happy to be able to pick our son up from nursery for once and i thought it went fine until she came home in tears.\n\nshe told me this nursery worker who has just started there didn\u2019t believe that my wife was our sons mother as this worker had only ever seen me. the other workers and my son told her that my wife was in fact the mother and that she wasn\u2019t a danger to my son. the new worker still didn\u2019t believe it and said that she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with letting a 3 year old go off with a random woman she\u2019d never seen before. my wife got really upset and it in then upset my son as everybody was practically saying there was no danger as my wife was a mother. a few other parents got dragged into this and backed up the other staff and it was only through relenting that the new worker gave up but she made a really angry comment along the lines of, \u201cmaybe if you were here more often, i wouldn\u2019t have to verify your identity.\u201d\n\nmy wife wants to forget it happened but i am very angry so the next day i picked up my son and asked to speak the woman in charge about the new worker. she wasn\u2019t there when it happened but i complained and said that how my wife was treated was ridiculous and that the coworker was out of line for her snide comment at the end. the woman wasn\u2019t happy and i\u2019ve now learnt the new worker has been given a severe warning and that her behaviour is being watched.\n\nthe parents who backed my wife up are torn. some think i did the right thing as the woman didn\u2019t act professional whilst others think i\u2019m an ah for interfering. my wife is annoyed as she thinks i shouldn\u2019t have said anything. i really don\u2019t know if what i did was right or wrong so am i

told them to stop and start learning chinese. i taught myself to be half fluent in chinese before i got my work assignment and learnt the rest in the 6 months i\u2019ve been here. they managed to get by because some of the staff spoke basic english but they left. i told them that they\u2019ve been here for several years and should be at least conversational in chinese. yeag chinese is hard butvits inconsiderate and rude to not put any effort into learning chinese. i told them im never translating for them again and they lost their shit saying i\u2019m an asshole and i\u2019m making their lives

work e. this is between me(19), my brother(23), my classmate(19) who is also my brother's girlfriend q, and my friend e(19).\n\n\nso my brother came to me before christmas and asked me to pick a drawing tablet from the online store. when asked why, he winked and said it was a christmas gift. because of the ambiguity of that i thought it was for me, as i study design and have recently mentioned that i wanted to change a tablet.\n\n\ni picked one of the better ones, one that i wanted for some time but was still saving up for. it was a few hundred bucks. my brother bought it without much hesitation, i was overjoyed.\n\n\nwhen the tablet arrived a few day before christmas, my brother wasn't home. i took the initiative to open the parcel and started to use the tablet. i know it was a little rude, but i was so sure it was meant for me so i din't think my brother would have bothered.\n\n\nwhen my brother came back, i thanked him for the present and my brother's confusion turned into annoyance when he saw that i have started to use the tablet. he told me that the tablet weren't for me, it was for his girlfriend q, my classmate, who also studies design and wants a new tablet.\n\n\ni have always been a rather emotional, so this embarrassment and disappointment had me ended up sniffling in tears. i knew i shouldn't have, but i couldn't control it. my brother, being a softie despite still being mad, gave it up and let me keep the tablet, consider it a christmas gift from him.\n\n\nhe got q something else for christmas, something much cheaper. i also got my brother something as expensive as i could afford without leaving me hungry till new year. even if the tablet wasn't for me initially, i was happy to have it.\n\n\ni mentioned this to one of my friends, e, and she said that i was being a big baby and shouldn't have kept the tablet.\n\n\nrecently for whatever reason that is, after months, e decided to tell this to q. q becomes very angry with me and my

outside of the home. she works 8-5 and i work 5:30am-2:30pm. \n\nthe past few months we\u2019ve had morning arguments because she says my routine wakes her up. i get up significantly earlier than her (about three hours before she wakes up) and she is not a morning person. \n\nhere are her issues: my dad works at the same place as me, so usually he will text me in the morning to make sure i\u2019m awake, he will keep texting until i answer or eventually call. i keep my phones volume all the way up so i can hear. a lot of the times i don\u2019t answer within the first time and by the second text my girlfriend wakes up. then there are my alarms. i snooze them a lot because i set them early so when i wake up, i know i have some time to sleep still. these usually wake her up to. it\u2019s just part of my routine. \n\nshe\u2019s a very light sleeper and has trouble going back to sleep once she is up. she gets so angry with me when this happens because she says she\u2019s exhausted.

alarm clock that turns the light on and it still doesn\u2019t help either of us. \n\nshe thinks i\u2019m an asshole because i just won\u2019t get up when my alarm goes off or my dad texts me, she says that would solve all our issues and that i\u2019m an asshole for not doing the simple solution so she can get a bit of sleep. i say she needs to learn to live with my routine. \n\naita here?", "so obviously the title is bad, and taken out of context clearly it's an asshole move, and i agree on principal with that. i believe i'm justified for what i said. i'm tired of being called an asshole by my family though, and i'd like some unbiased opinions.\n\nmy family has struggled a little bit the last couple of years financially. we've had bills paid, thank god, but not a ton of extra money to do things i wish i was able to do with my kids.\n\nmy wife and i have a 6 year old daughter and 3 year old son together. \n\nholidays have been rough the past couple of years, i can't even lie. money isn't what's most important, but there's a real pain of looking at your daughter see others who get more and are better off. \n\nthat being said we tried to do the best we could to make the holidays as special as possible. our daughter got a ton of little gifts that when wrapped made the presents under the tree look like a ton. she was happy of course, she has such a positive attitude all the time, but when she receives something she's extremely grateful and i couldn't be more proud of how she handles herself. last year santa brought her a bike as the big present. \n\nmy wife has 2 brothers and a sister. the sister is married and has 3 kids with her husband. one in particular is awful, let's call her sid. hell raiser classic type. ruins every family outing or tries too anyways,

all 3 of the kids are at our house. i'm in the kitchen cooking. my daughter and sid are at the table in the dining room. the conversation is christmas and what they are expecting and would like to get. \n\nsid won't stop bragging about the presents she got last year. i didn't catch all of it or know what they all were but obviously expensive and glamorous enough to make my daughter envious. my daughter questioned out loud, \"i wonder why santa brings you more than me.\" to which sid replied basically with her being better than my daughter. she wasn't good enough to get the gifts sid gets. i could see my daughter processing this and believing something about how she is wasn't good enough compared to this spoiled brat. so i couldn't take it. i told sid in front of my daughter santa wasn't real. it was her parents that supply the gifts. she definitely should never think getting material things makes her better than anybody. \n\nthis was news to sid and my little girl. neither knew how to react, tho once explaining everything to my daughter i'm proud of the lesson that came out thru all this. my wife's sister is pissed at me for telling her daughter this. said they were talking like normal kids and i ruined something for her. i say she was getting the wrong message anyways and i wasn't going to stand by her relaying her point of view on my daughter. aita?", "", "my sister \u201cjulie\u201d has tried to have a baby for 5 years. she had a miscarriage 2 years ago and outside that, has been unable to get pregnant. my heart hurts for her. however, one thing i don\u2019t agree with is how my family has handled it. we\u2019re not allowed to talk about babies around julie. any kids younger than 3 can\u2019t come to family events that she\u2019ll attend. she won\u2019t attend baby showers, baptisms, etc. the last one i understand, but the rest feels overkill. \n\ni got pregnant last year. i told julie first and she reiterated her boundaries. i said i understood. the first hurdle came with my baby shower. my mil was throwing it. i didn\u2019t expect julie to come. then my mom told me i shouldn\u2019t have one period, \u201cout of respect\u201d. i said that was ridiculous. she didn\u2019t have to come so what did it matter? only 3 people from my side of the family came to the shower.\n\nwhen my son was born, i posted a birth announcement on facebook. my parents lectured me for this and said it was going to hurt julie. i said she could just block or mute me. they said i should make the effort. julie echoed that if i cared, i\u2019d stop. i ended up blocking her just to save drama. \n\nmy aunt\u2019s 70th birthday party is next week. my husband and i planned to go, bringing our son. julie called and asked if we were going. she then asked for me to get a sitter for our son. i said no. she doesn\u2019t want to miss the party. my aunt is one of the few people who agree that julie\u2019s boundaries aren\u2019t fair and wants my son there, as she doesn\u2019t get to see him often. julie got upset and started crying, saying that i was unfair. \n\ni finally snapped and asked what would happen when she got pregnant? would we all be expected to shower her with the love and attention she\u2019s refused to give other people\u2019s kids? will her baby be allowed to attend events? she said that was different. i said no, i\u2019m not coddling her anymore. my son exists, he\u2019s family and he\u2019s coming. she can decide if she wants to or not.\n\nmy parents yelled at me for being mean to julie. they offered to pay for a sitter but i said

constantly throughout the day.\n\n\nanyways, she keeps getting alot of compliments on her curls and when people ask how she gets them to look so natural she says it's her natural hair. well the other day we ran into my friends at the store, and i was introducing them. my friends wife mentioned how much she loved her hair and how she can never get hers to hold curls and asked for advice on how she gets hers to look so curly. my wife, like usual, said \"oh it's my natural hair!\" and my friends wife was telling her how jealous she was and how she wishes she could have curls like that.\n\n\nwell it kind of annoyed me because well, that's not her natural hair, she spends a good hour every time she showers on it and constantly messes with it and puts a ton of product in it (to the point where i can taste it sometimes if it's in my face). so i said \"well i mean that's not really your natural hair but ok\". she kind of paused and gave me a look, and said \"i mean i do have naturally curly hair so...\" my friends looked kind of awkward for a minute and said well time to head out nice seeing you and left.\n\n\nwell the second we got to the car she went off on me and yelled at me for embarrassing her. we got in a big fight about it and i told her i just think it's weird of her to always say her hair is naturally curly instead of just giving them advice on how she gets it like that and at the very least she could of told my friends wife that it's not like she was talking to some stranger. she got even more pissed and said it was her natural hair and then we started to argue about if it was or not. now shes not really talking to me.\n\n\naita here?", "my son is indian, and his friend, who is white, are both 9. my son brought his friend over after school on the bus. i

freezer food. i told her i provided free childcare without notice, and her kid chose not to eat what everyone else ate. i continued that when i was a child, my mom didn\u2019t offer anyone

ago when lacey started her period. i knew this day would come so i spoke to my sister, my female best friend and my mother in law to be well prepared. i gave her the talk with her grandmother and aunt there, i buy her pads and tampons, i even have midol and heating pads ready for lacey when she needs them. \n\nthe problem began when i began to notice a smell coming from lacey\u2019s room. i went in to investigate and found pads and tampons openly disposed of in her wastebasket. i checked her bathroom and it was worse. she had her bloodstained undergarments in the tub.\n\ni took out her trash and did my best to get rid of the smell, but i didn\u2019t know what to do with the underwear in the tub. later, i noticed bloodstains on the couch. it took a while of cleaning but i got them out. i figured that was the end of that.\n\nit happened again last month, when i noticed lacey\u2019s room was stinking again. and i saw she didn\u2019t even wash the underwear from before. the bathroom was unbearable at this point. then earlier this week, i saw bloodstains on the couch again.\n\ni sat lacey down and told her that she had to learn to properly dispose of her feminine hygiene products and wash her underwear as the smell was becoming too much. and to be careful of getting bloodstains on the couch or anywhere she sits. i also noticed her sheets had a lot of bloodstains and brought this up too. i also let her know that it was okay to get blood on things as long as she washed them, and i wouldn\u2019t be upset if i saw her bloodstained items being washed.\n\nlacey immediately blew up at me saying that periods aren\u2019t gross and that i was period shaming and that i needed to educate myself on menstruation. i then got texts from my sister and mil scolding me for making lacey feel ashamed of her bodily functions. \n\nbut i honestly wasn\u2019t trying to convey that periods are gross. i was trying to convey that her hygiene needed to be addressed and that the smell was becoming unbearable. i just wanted to make sure that lacey knew how to properly dispose of pads and tampons without it smelling, and that i wouldn\u2019t be annoyed if she washed her bloodstained items \n\naita here? was i period shaming my daughter?", "in 2017 i moved in with 2 roommates from craigslist in their mid-20\u2019s, heather &amp; jeff. i lived with them for a little under a year. heather was on the shyer, more reserved side and not easy to talk to, but we got along well. i moved out just over a year ago about 20 miles away, and hadn\u2019t seen her since, though we\u2019re still friends on facebook.\n\nrecently, i joined a new gym, &amp; my second time there i was surprised to see someone who instantly recognized as heather behind the front desk! this was surprising as she lives 20 miles away; but i was absolutely certain it was her. i said, \u201chey heather! good to see you again.\u201d she gave me a really funny stare and told me she\u2019s not heather.\n\nher voice sounded just like heather\u2019s as well. she told me her name is maddie, and it was clear she didn\u2019t recognize me. i walked away feeling super embarrassed and puzzled. that girl looked, sounded and acted **so** identical to heather in every way, shape and form; to a degree that is impossible to be a simple coincidence.\n\ni pondered things in my mind, and on my way out approached maddie. i asked her, \u201csorry if this is too personal, but i\u2019m wondering - are you adopted by any chance?\u201d she responded that she is, but hasn\u2019t made any effort to find her bio family. i told her that i strongly suspect that i know her identical twin sister, and explained things to her.\u00a0\n\ni showed a picture of heather on my phone to her, and to my surprise she didn\u2019t act all that impressed, just giving me a simple, \u201chmmmm. okay.\u201d i told her that i have heather\u2019s #, am friends with her on facebook, have her address and would be happy to connect them, and she responded disinterestedly, \u201cno thanks.\u201d\n\ni called heather later &amp; explained things to her, and **she too** seemed disinterested. i found maddie\u2019s profile on facebook (by searching \u201cpeople who work at \\[name of my gym\\]\u201d) and texted heather photos of her. but still, she acted disinterested. i\u2019ve met heather\u2019s parents &amp; they strongly resemble her, so what i suspect is that heather\u2019s mom had an extra baby (maddie) that she gave up for adoption and never told her about.\n\ni continued going to the gym, and almost every time i went maddie would be there. every time i saw heather\u2019s exact double, it would continue to bug me. i feel like i discovered something really amazing and groundbreaking, and it\u2019s going unappreciated.\n\ni added maddie on facebook and she accepted. maybe she didn\u2019t know it was me, since i have the mascot for a beloved baseball team of mine instead of a picture of myself as my profile picture. having both girls as friends, i messaged both of them into a three-way facebook chat, finally forcing them to interact with one another.\n\ni was promptly blocked by both of them, and don\u2019t know how things turned out. i\u2019m now pretty nervous to go to the gym, and am considering looking for a new one. was i the asshole to try and reunite these girls who i\u2019m positive are twins?", "i (19 m) had a job taking care of two kids (2m, 3f), a dog, and doing light housework 4 days a week for a single mom who got my contact info from a business card i had posted in my dad's pediatric therapy office.\n\never since the weather started getting warmer, the dog has been shedding like crazy. like, i would vacuum the couch and the next day it would look like i hadn't, i would lightly tug on the dog's hair and would pull out huge tufts, the dog's been scratching all the time, etc. my dad's dog has a double coat like theirs, and one morning when i was leaving for work i packed his brushing tool in my bag. when the kids were napping, i spent a full hour outside brushing the dog.\n\nthe dog seemed to enjoy being brushed, and after an hour there was a huge pile of hair that had been brushed out. before i vacuumed it up, i sent the mom what i thought would be a funny text saying, \"brushed a whole new dog out of \\[dog\\]'s coat!\"\n\nlooking back, i realize that maybe i should have asked first, but at the time it seemed like something that was within the scope of caring for the dog. the mom went ballistic. she called me yelling, saying that by brushing the dog and not letting the hair fall out on its own i was causing harm to the dog. she said i was an idiot and she can't believe she trusted me with her kids, and that today was my last day. i was extremely upset because i had been with the family for 3 months and she had never yelled at me like that before. i left as soon as she got home because she was still fuming. i immediately lined up a job with another family and am supposed to start monday.\n\nthe mom who yelled at me called me two days later saying that she was sorry about the \"misunderstanding\" and that firing me was an overreaction. i told her i was no longer available and she started crying about how hard it was to find a new sitter for \"special needs\" kids (her kids are autistic and have therapy at my dad's office). when i stood firm, she started texting my dad and asking him to do something. my dad is annoyed at being dragged into this, and while he respects my decision he wishes i would keep watching her kids for a short time to \"keep the peace\". i hate that i put anyone in an awkward position, but i also don't want to work for someone like that. aita?\n\nedit because i don't want to have to keep clarifying: my dad is not an aba therapist. he's a physical therapist.

he enjoys running everyday as a way to relieve stress and anxiety.\nmy stepson jake/*17 saw the sneakers and said they looked like the ones his favorite artist 'kane brown was wearing in 'famous friends music video and so he got so hung up on them. always asking chris to see them and try them on. chris let him see them but not wear them because jake has bigger feet and he was worried he might ruin them.\n\njake wanted to wear the sneakers infront of his friends but chris didn't let him leave the house with them. jake ended up sneaking out with them a couple of times which made chris hide them from him since he kept taking them without permission. jake was no longer able to sneak out wearing the sneakers and begged chris to let him wear them out one last time in a party his friends had. chris said no and jake somehow was able to locate the sneakers but instead of going out with them he cut them with hand preuner and kept them in his room while chris and i looked for them til his mom found them.\n\nchris saw the damage and was upset i grounded jake and promised chris to get a replacement but when his mom called to tell me those sneakers are worth *600$* and had to be replaced i was in utter shock. i saw the recipient and even then i couldn't believe it because 600$ is way more than i can afford (chris' mom is a cardiologist she can afford this stuff but i obviously can't) i was fuming i let jake know how much he messed up and told him i will be replacing the sneakers using the money he saved for his week long summer camp. jake had a meltdown and said he was already punished and it wasn't fair to punish him further.\nmy wife thought i exaggerated and talked about how important summer camp is for jake as he's been waiting for it for months. i let her know that chris' mom is rightfully upset her gift for him got ruined and because jake acted out of spite and maliciousness then it's only fair he'd pay for replacement. my wife assured me if jake knew those sneakers were that expensive he would've never ever touched them but thought chris wasn't letting him borrow them on purpose. what's done is done and i made my decision final. both my wife and jake are giving me the silent treatment and refusing to talk about it. my wife thinks it's crazy to spend 600$ on new sneakers, i agree but those aren't mine so needed replacement. so aita??\n\neta that because chris' mom sends somewhat expensive items to chris, jake would sometimes feel jealous which is understandable, i make sure to treat both boys equally by getting them equal stuff. my wife thinks that chris should be sharing with his brother and he does but there are things that just can not be shared.", "hey y'all. read carefully before giving judgement!.\n\nso my wife (f24) and i (m27) had our son 3 months ago. luckily as new parents we've had less issues compared to others in our family but what really created an issue was the fact that my wife gets wayyyy more bonding time with my son than i do. she breastfeeds and doesn't let me come anywhere near her while she's doing it claiming she was already in pain and i was making her stressed out with my behavior. she'd promise to let me have my bonding time once she's done but she takes a long time feeding and then the baby goes to sleep so i get pretty much,...almost, no time to bond with him.\n\n\nit all came to head for me last night after my wife told me to leave the room while she was feeding our son cause i was '''bothering,,, her and making her feel '''stressed out,,, with my ''\"judgemental,,, comments but i was just making sure she was feeding our son properly since she's dealing with stress and possible ppd and so i had to **(not under doctor's recommendation though but following my mom's advice)** be present in every feeding session to make sure nothing goes wrong and...like i said before maybe get a chance to bond with my son but it didn't end well and i refused to leave the room. she tried to unload on me about how unsupportive and difficult i was being but i told her she was wrong to exclude me and take away my attempt at bonding with my son and that it's only fair that i get to have equal time she has with him and suggested that she switch to formula so she has no way of keeping me excluded and again so i could get 50% of the time she has with him. she called me unreasonable and explained that even though i'm the parent too she as a mother is essentially what our son needs and relies on so her role is more important and she gets more time than i do simply because she's the mother. .....then she explained that my request was ridiculous because she is blessed to have almost no issues with bf and switching to formula was absolutely uncalled for and can not be afforded right now but i disagreed and argued that she left me no choice and that she needs to respect whatever decision i make regarding our son even if she doesn't like it and doesn't necessary agree with it but she argued back saying i'm delusional to think she'll just switch to formula to fix my hurt '''feefees,,, and even accused me of making this request so mom could meddle in and start feeding our son formula and have sleepovers since she was against her breastfeeding from the start due to how weak she was before. this really had me...kind of...lose my cool ngl. i told her that couldn't be further from the truth. matter fact, i strongly believe her refusal to consider switching to formula is mainly to spite mom not because she thinks my request was '''unreasonable,,,\n\nlong story short, we kept going back and forth on this argument and she told me to drop it but i refused because in my opinion she's being selfish by how she's treating me as the other parent.", "i\u2019m 22,

refused.\n\n\nyesterday i got home and found that my wife was locking herself in the bedroom and crying. i asked what happened, she told me she woke up and didn't find her wig, then discovered my

door to keep a distance cause they didn't stop. i was fuming i went into the kitchen and confronted them, they acted confused but i was able to get the wig back. i lashed out telling them they humiliated my wife and barrassed her by taking away her wig. they said it was just lighthearted prank which made me go off on them. my sister got involved and said my wife was just being too sensitive and the girls were just curios to see her without a wig but she overreacted. i told her her daughters were recording her! she saw nothing wrong in it and said i overreacted as well. i lost it on her too and told her she and my nieces are no longer welcome to stay at my home and they needed to leave. i later let them know about the eviction since they thought i wasn't serious and they started

probably not make it. obviously she was devastated. things got really hectic we got called out to another fire and our captain said one of us could go but not both. i told my colleague not to worry she should go and spend time with her grandfather since it will be her last chance. so i had to go out and missed the birth of my child. i got there 2 hours after my girl was born. i felt horrible and

she appreciated it greatly but couldn\u2019t lie to me that she wished it had been the necklace she pointed out to me online (it was nothing fancy, a $30 mushroom necklace). i shared my woes with my

meanwhile all my neighbors essentially got tiny strip right behind their houses.\n\nnow the part right behind my house is fenced off yet the rest is pretty much open and my wife and daughters like to

this is important later.\n\nwell this is where the issue starts, recently a new family moved in and they seem to think it is public land. i kept catching their kids running around through the flowers and vegetable garden and they even moved their grill on the field and held a picnic on my land. i keep telling them off and informing it is my land, but they just ignore me and the kids sometimes wont leave when i tell them to. a month ago the kids even climbed over the fence around the pool  and when i got them out and went to their parents they just said \"oh we figured it was a public pool\", i had hoped that was the end of it yet these people build a fire pit in the 3 days i was away from my house and when i got back i found it with a bunch of empty beer cans around.\n\nthat was the last straw for me and i hired a company owned by a buddy of mine from when i used to do construction work, bought all the supplies, and 7 days later and a lot of money lighter my entire property was walled

meet.\n\nboth me and my wife work full-time. we each have separate accounts that we use for our \"fun\" money for hobbies or whatever we want. we earn almost the same amount of money, with me being a little higher, so i contribute 60% and she contributes 40% to make things fair and also so we each have about the same amount of \"fun money.\" we also have a joint checking and savings account that we use for the household bills and household emergency fund (like when the water heater flooded the basement in the middle of the night). both of us have access to the joint accounts, and if we need to use it, it is never an issue, so long as we make sure to tell the other that we used funds from those accounts. \n\nas i was going through the statements for our joint household account, i noticed that there was approximately $2,000.00 missing from the joint savings account. i noticed that they were all venmo transfers to her sister. when my wife came home from work i asked what this was about, and she told me that her sister needed money to start her own business. my wife sat me down and explained to me that her sister joined yet another freaking pyramid scheme, this time selling fake nails and makeup. my wife said that she has the potential to earn six figures a month and if that was true. my wife also said that she too was going to join her sister selling these products and if she made enough would quit her job and sell them full-time with her sister.\n\ni told my wife that she either needs to get that money back from her sister or i would open a new account for my share of the household expenses and transfer it to that account when it was time to pay bills. my wife is upset with me and does not understand why i am being so unsupportive. i told my wife that not only did she take money and not tell me about it, she invested it into something without even considering how i would feel about it. \n\nmy sil called me last night and said that i was a raging ah and a control

a bio son 'leo', 16 from my previous relationship. i married his step mom who is a mother of two boys 'connor',20 (deceased) and 'derek',12. i've never had the pleasure to meet connor who tragically passed away from a motorcycle accident. derek was so devastated by this loss and although it's been years he's still pretty much grieving.  i've seen tons of pictures and videos of connor and made efforts to get to know who he was as a way to share derek's grief and be there for him to lend an ear and a comforting shoulder. it's safe to say that derek and i grew a strong bond in no time. but my son leo isn't close to derek. understandable because not all siblings and step siblings are the same. leo and derek are different in everything which isn't a bad thing but leo calls himself the brutally honest type and makes insensitive comments about derek most of the time. they tend to be under the guise of 'advice'. derek never complained so i had to step in and tell leo to stop being insensitive towards his stepbrother especially, with everything regarding conner and his memory. leo would say \"ok i get it\" and \"i won't do it again\".\n\ndays ago, leo wanted to hang out with friends and asked derek if he wanted to join. derek agreed and put on connor's hoodie before going out. leo commented on the hoodie and called it ugly and asked him to put on something else but derek insisted on wearing it or not go. leo dropped it.\n\nhours later derek came home crying with his hoodie in hand. he said leo and friends cut it into pieces while he was in the bathroom after they convinced him to take it off. i was furious i asked leo and he said it was his friend's idea then said he had to do it since derek wears it everywhere and it looked old and embarrassing. i reminded him who this hoodie belonged to and he said \"so what, maybe this will help him move on in life\". i told him his birthday was cancelled and his friends aren't welcome anymore.\nhe pitched a fit saying his birthday was a right not a privilege and i can't cancel it. he had my ex criticize my decision and wanted to host his birthday party but i refused because he's grounded so no party anywhere. she and her family called me awful and ridiculous and asked me to think how leo will hate me for this but i insisted he needed punishment for putting his stepbrother through this.\n\nnote:

opportunity to give a forum to people to say what they need to say to me and make peace with me and commune with me and feel it won\u2019t be nearly as cathartic if i am not there as it would be to do it while i am still alive. \n\ni could really benefit from some insight here. because there\u2019s a really valid argument that i\u2019ll deal with the fallout of the pre-funeral for a few months at

told me to wait 5 minutes.\n\n5 minutes turned into 30 and by that time he had to be in a meeting which lasted over an hour. i got impatient and i was hungry so i decided to just climb on the chair

\n\nhe tried to use it as justification for why i shouldn\u2019t have been on the chair in the first place but i told him it was his fault because if he hadn\u2019t scared me i never would\u2019ve almost fallen. i also said it was his fault because he hadn\u2019t got it for me when i asked and he said he was sorry but he had a meeting. i asked him what the point of being the boss was if he couldn\u2019t be 30 seconds late to help his pregnant wife quickly, which in hindsight was a petty thing to say. this really upset him and he told me not to blame him and that i shouldn\u2019t have

issues on my end. however, she told me she was pregnant. i was overjoyed. she told me she would only keep it if i was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, i said i was fully committed, and we kept the baby.\n\nas time went on, i became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was mine. i did the math and thought it was unlikely it was mine, on top of having a gut feeling. i was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, i could barely even hold him because i was so convinced he wasn't mine.\n\ni told my wife i wanted a paternity test. she was upset but told me to get one if it would ease my mind. the test comes back two weeks later and it says i am not the father.\n\ni'm absolutely livid. i had an out of body experience. i stormed into our house and just let loose. i felt like i couldn't stop myself, i was completely broken in that moment. i cried and screamed and asked her what i did to deserve this. i absolutely never laid a hand on her.\n\nthe whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. this made me even angrier for some reason, so i kicked her out right then and there. told her to pack her bags and just get out.\n\nshe calls me the next day and tells me that i deserve to know that the baby is mine, and asks me to get a paternity test from another company. i figure i have nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help me in a divorce, so we get one at the company she suggested, and i sent a third to another company, just to be sure.\n\ni get the results from one and

for a paternity test and my reaction to the false one. she tells me i can come see my son, but she will be filing for divorce.\n\ni don't think my reaction was over the top for a man who thought he was being lied to about one of the most important things. i never showed any sort of violence and i was so emotionally broken at that point. i know how it must have looked to her, knowing that i was

still have to take out a few loans to finish things up. she had to get a new car because the old one was cursed and was in more accidents while parked than we can count. and she did go through a manic period and almost run up her credit card in her early 20s shopping so much. however, she spent a lot of time getting her finances in order, worked multiple side gigs on top of her normal job, which i commend her for, and now is debt free except for her mortgage, which she makes a ton of extra payments towards, and has almost 300k in investments, savings, etc. i'm very proud of her for everything

wanted me to be debt free. we chose a date 3 years from now, since some of our family is out of the country and needs to save, and so it will be on our 7th anniversary, both of our favorite number. she pulled out a spread sheet of my debts, and pointed out how if i put all of my paychecks, minus maybe 200 a month for \"fun money\" into paying off my debt, i'll be debt free by the wedding. she would cover everything else - the mortgage, food, bills, insurance, our pets, vacations, date nights, etc. we could then both aggressively save for that last bit of time for a nice honeymoon, and after that focus a good amount of our funds on taking out the mortgage and getting my own savings up to snuff. \n\ni thought about it for a day or so and came back with this counter offer: she pays off my debts and i pay her back in a year and a half, since i wouldn't also have to be paying interest, we would put a bigger dent in the mortgage, and still stick to the timeline. she seemed unhappy with this, and said she would have to think about it first. \n\ni casually mentioned it to my friends over beer to get another perspective, and they said i'm the asshole, and they would do anything

christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents early. so we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them. it was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement when i told them they could open it on christmas eve. they tore into it like a couple savages. i'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get at the goods. \n\nas the final paper was ripped off the present, the oldest was going like \"it's a..it's a\" and the final paper came off, \"brick\". i thought it was hilarious. the looks on their faces was priceless.

connecting with the deaf community in my area and learn asl. he did not, and while he stayed for the birth, he moved in with his brother right after dropping me off at my home. i own the house, and did before i met him, so it's not part of the divorce. he was nice enough to give me 2 months worth of a cleaning service and a gift card to grubhub. \n\nhe ended up telling everyone that i am the reason he doesn't see our child, and that i filed for divorce because i overreacted.  the truth is that i have sole custody because he cried, in court, that he couldn't \"deal\" with the baby and wanted to just pay support. while i did file, it was because he abandoned me and said so many horrible things that i couldn't get over. \n\ni have text messages he sent me which say that he wouldn't have married me if he knew that we would produce \"problems\" and that he couldn't handle raising a \"r******\" (the only thing wrong with her is hearing). i don't want my child to grow up in a home where she's hated. \n\ni was starting to hear all sorts of crap from my family and his, who started to take his side because divorce isn't really a thing here, so i took action. i made a social media

person to use the bathroom, so i come out and asked her if she tried to flush a pad down the toilet. she got embarrassed and said yes, and i told her she needed to go clean up the mess she made. there was water all over the floor, with particles of her pad and blood everywhere. i asked her if no one ever taught her not to flush a pad, we have a septic tank and they cost thousands to repair. you

like, \"uhh you're just going to leave this here?\" and i said yes. he said he would have to wake up extra early to clean up and that he had to be at work earlier than usual and was supposed to play a

took the time to cool off. \n\ni needed this time because i was seriously and suddenly regretting a lot of the sacrifices i made for this woman, when it wasn\u2019t like i didn\u2019t have other

herself, maybe on one or two occasions out of the two years and thousands of meals we have had together. she isn't perse selfish with her food but she doesn't like to share with me all of the time. which i just kind of find rather annoying considering she does not finish all of her food. for example, if we are out to eat usually i will reach my hand over and try to sample a bite while her food is hot and fresh because i want a taste. she will sometimes smack my hand away and tell me to wait. then an argument always ensues because she thinks i should \"give her the courtesy of at least trying to finish her meal before i touch it\" which is annoying to me because i know she won't finish it and she knows i like my food scalding hot. i usually won't even eat it if it's room temperature.\n\nthe reason i'm asking if i'm ta here is that this weekend we went to a fair in our town and she got a basket of three fried oreos and when she brought it over i took one and she got really upset saying \"you know i wait for these all year round and i wanted to eat all of them!\" which was probably a lie but she seemed kind of upset for the rest of the night about it. i'm pretty

back to visit my family about once a month (in england). at home, we speak both english and french to our children (my husband is belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in english in a french sentence or vice-versa. this has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school.\n\nmy sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and i will just gently correct him.\n\nanyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. i sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and i thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. my husband was talking to my dad outside and i was feeding my daughter in the other room, and i'd left louis with sarah and dave. when i came back downstairs, louis was crying, and i managed to understand that he'd tried to ask sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. i asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that i shouldn't be \"ignoring my son's obvious speech issues.\" for context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. she told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.\n\nthis really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle louis. that night at the dinner table, sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in \"bad\" english (she is english, i just mean that she asked for it in slang. think, \"pass *us* the peas, will you\". i had a bit of an epiphany and i just decided to totally ignore her. she asked again, and i did the same thing. my brother asked why i was ignoring his wife and i said that i'm not able to reply if she can't speak english correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar.\n\neveryone's pretty pissed off with me and i admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my

me but he was always more interested his own children than me, in fact he always showed very little interest in me. i've always felt like a second class family member, my mom treats my step brother exactly like me but step father doesn't do the same for me.\n\nanyway, this last couple of years have been difficult because step father started doing stuff with my siblings, like going on trips, going fishing or hiking, father-children bonding moments as he calls it and he's never taken me with them despite me asking to go, initially he always said maybe next time until i called him out last week and he took me aside and explained that this is for him and his children, i'm not his child like they are, he said he loves me but it's different, he can't dilute the experience by bringing me as well but he said my mom can spend some mother-child moments with me and my sister if she wants to as well, and that it would be good for us to have that only for us. this conversation happened on friday before they went off for a weekend trip.\n\nmy mom told me that this is how he feels, she can't change it but she's made sure i'm always treated equally when it comes to money (which is true) but she can't change the way he feels so i need to accept it. \n\ni've been thinking all weekend and it was clear to me that when he doesn't see me as his son, it's wrong of me to see him as my dad. so i decided that if i'm the step child he tolerates because of my mom, i'm not going to pretend like we're anything more. i decided to stop calling him dad and go by his first name. so on sunday night after they returned i said hi tom. he was surprised but didn't say anything. at dinner he asked me what was that about and i explained that i don't want to dilute the experience he has with his real children by calling him dad when clearly i'm not his son. it's something that should be kept for his actual children. i was told to go to my room by my mom. later she came to me and said this has hurt him and i should apologize, i said i'm just following his lead and treating him exactly like how he wants to be treated by his actions, and if he's hurt then he should look in the mirror because that's his actions.\n\nmy mom told me in the end that this is the man who has raised me all my life and i need to apologize and show remorse. she says he's 95% of the way for being a dad to me, i shouldn't ignore all of that and focus on the missing 5% and reject him entirely. i declined, said he's the one who needs to apologize if he wants things to change between us. am i being the asshole

invited my son to attend as well.\n\nmy wife was hesitant to consent to this. she said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. especially since she loves disney and princesses. i said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. so we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. my wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go.\n\ni gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. he did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. still, when she saw him come back wearing a star wars shirt with the mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. my wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go.\n\ni (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. now, we are not well off financially, but my bil is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. my wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to \"even the score.\"\n\ni told my wife that isn't happening. we are their parents. we can't favor one child over the other. not being invited to the birthday trip of a kid you barely know is in no way comparable to being left out of a *family vacation* and i'm shocked

had a competitive relationship. my therapist says we were put in competition against each other as kids by our parents and that's carried over as adults. 6 months ago i sat down with my sister and we agreed that it's fucked up how we both acted and we want to be loving sisters who aren't constantly trying to get one over on each other, and we came to a truce.\n\nshe got married today. i am 4+ months pregnant, so there's a baby bump. the dress i bought a few months ago with my sister was now clinging to said bump so i changed my outfit to a loose blouse and slacks to hide it, which worked, and texted her a picture of the new outfit along with a lie about spilling wine on the dress. she approved the new outfit. once there an aunt comes over to talk to me and comments on me not drinking. i panicked and grabbed a glass of champagne and she left. when i thought no one was looking i gave my glass to my husband to take a sip from so it would look like i'd had some. dad then comes over and says \"something wrong with the champagne?\" i say it's fine. dad says \"take a sip then\". i hesitate and he says \"you're not pregnant are you?\". i go \"please don't say anything, it's sister's big day and we're waiting to tell people\". he says he won't. barely 5 minutes later another aunt comes over and congratulates us with tears in her eyes and hugs me. i know i should have said dad was wrong, but she was literally crying, so i tell her we're trying to keep it quiet because it's not our day and she nods, hugs me again, and leaves.\n\nwhat follows is basically every one of my family members congratulating us. i can see my sister getting upset so i go over and explained what happened, and say we really didn't mean to do this. my sister says that it's probably for the best that we leave, so we do. i get home, go on social media, and just about every post from my relatives is something like \"sister's wedding was lovely and thrilled to hear about op being pregnant!\" and now my sister has privately messaged me saying \"so much for not one upping each other\" and \"you couldn't let me have one day\". i told her it was an accident, but she says i could have done more to hide it and then she sends another message basically saying she can't believe i've not even apologised for causing a scene at her wedding. it's true i haven't apologised but i feel like i went to great lengths to not tell people, it's not my fault they found out, and i'm being made to feel like i did something wrong when i took precautions on my end.\n\naita for not apologising for accidentally announcing my pregnancy?", "", "i have an almost three year old beautiful little girl. she\u2019s just a few weeks shy of her third birthday. my baby was out in hospice four weeks ago after having gone into remission late may. unfortunately, the cancer has returned except it is now crushing her optic nerve and is about 8cm long. multiple doctors recommended we make our daughter as comfortable as possible as they do not believe removing the tumor is a good option. i have so much to say in regards to her diagnosis but heartbroken will suffice for now.\n\nmy husband and i have been making tons of memories with her for the past few weeks. we\u2019ve included family in some of these memories but we both feel that we want to spend as much time with our daughter as possible. my mother in law called me yesterday to tell me she booked tickets/hotel/airfare for a trip next month. i thought it sounded fun until she said she was taking our toddler with her. just her, my daughter, and her husband. she did not invite my husband and i.\n\nmy daughter isn\u2019t even three yet. she has never stayed overnight anywhere and mother in law wants to take her for one entire week across the country, alone. i suggested that my husband and i both go that way our daughter is comfortable and for gods sake in the event she dies? she can\u2019t be gone for a week. her nurses are here. her care is here.\n\ni suggested what if we all go for a shorter amount of time. i came up with various suggestions to which all were turned down. i should add that if my daughter was not in hospice i still would not be comfortable with our toddler being across the country for a week alone without her parents. my child being in hospice adds another layer of complexity to the situation. \n\ni told my mother in law that her decisions that she made alone without consulting us was a solid no. she called me a few names and hung up on me. she then called my husband and called me a few names and suggested she would fight for rights before my daughter dies. \n\ni\u2019m already grieving. my husband said we should acquiesce to his mothers trip to avoid drama (even though he agrees that our daughter is too young). but i want to spend time with her before the cancer takes her, she\u2019s too little etc. i said no for various reasons not just to say no.", "i (15f) am my mother's (35f) only daughter she has from her previous marriage. she has three children the rest being (18, 16) boys, this is important to know.\n\nlast week my mom was talking with one of her friends about the color she wanted the bridesmaids dresses to be. my mom had been planning this wedding with her new boyfriend for the past two months or so, they have been engaged for about one year. the wedding is in december and on the day before my birthday, me and my mom have been planning a party for me around the same time she was for the wedding. she insisted it was alright and that her boyfriend and her would go on their honeymoon the next day.\n\nwhile she was talking i asked her when we were going to look for my dress since she had asked me to be the flower girl. i could see the disappointed look on her face when i asked her which confused me. she responded only a few minutes later and said \"we'll talk about it later.\" a few hours later my mom came to me. i thought she was going to talk about the dress situation but instead she sat me down and explained how her new boyfriend thought it'd be a better fit for their three daughters to lead the wedding. \n\nwhatever, i was cool with that, but it's important to note that my mom had always wanted all girls, i was a girl but i had looked too much like my father which caused a strain in our relationship. my dad explained to me how my mother had postpartum when she had me and just couldn't connect with me because of it. so when she gave birth to my three younger step siblings who all looked like her(triplets 6yo) she was obviously overjoyed, it hurt to see but i was happy for her. my brother's had a similar experience but were significantly better because they looked more like her. i know this is an over dramatic thing to say but sometimes i feel like because my mother didn't feel as connected with me at birth was because i was a letdown right out the gate. \n\nafter she was done i asked her again about the dress because i still didn't have one, again that same disappointed look on her face came before telling me i wasn't invited to the wedding, simply because her boyfriend thought i would upset his family because i was from my mom's previous marriage and he didn't like my dad. she also explained how my birthday isn't happening either due to him wanting to go on their honeymoon right away. it turned into a screaming match with me yelling \"i'm sorry i don't look like you enough for you to love me. i'm sorry you were too conceited for you to get over the fact i look like my dad.\" \n\ni was kicked out by her boyfriend within the same hour because she had cried to him about what i said. all my brothers know what happened and have now refused to go to the wedding which upset her even more, though i don't care about how she feels right now. my brothers had an actual relationship with her and i probably just messed it up by letting my anger get the best of me.\n\naita?", "my brother died before his firstborn child was born, because of this i've had an above average involvement in my nephews life. one thing i\u2019ve always done is build him toys and furniture. it was a way of providing without the awkwardness of handing over cash. also, between my late brothers cash and life insurance via work a trust was setup for my nephew for ~\u00a3500,000. he wasn\u2019t actually married to my sil.\n\nnow via the lab at work i\u2019ve made him a lot of wooden or 3d printed toys, but also some simple handmade electronic toys. my sister in law was always grateful for these and my nephew (by all accounts) loves his custom toys.\n\nfast forward 3 years and my former sister in law has gotten married. i was attending my nephews third birthday and i turned up the night before to assemble his present. it was a small climbing frame/swing set i had watched better carpenters than me in the lab make.\n\nthe new husband was a little standoffish but come the day of the party he was telling anyone who listened that i didn\u2019t pay or make the present i had lackies at work do it for free. this culminated in him calling all my \u201cpresents\u201d an embarrassment and given my fancy job i could afford to splash some cash.\n\ni confronted him and my former sil and she basically confirmed that whilst the presents were appreciated she honestly expected more direct support from me after my brothers death. my mother stepped in and reminded her my brother paid for this house and they regularly take cash out of the trust (approx \u00a310,000 a year).\n\nwe walked out without hearing any worthwhile response but i continued to see my nephew without incident. 6-7 months go by and i\u2019m visiting only to be told my former sil was pregnant with twins and she was wondering if i could make some duplicates of items i made for my nephew as they needed two sets.\n\ni scoffed, said she had balls asking me to make stuff after she was so ungrateful and i owe her unborn children very little. she got upset and explained her prior statements about my handmade gifts and said she felt they were the kinda little things someone did as a favour. not what a family provides. that\u2019s why she\u2019s asking me now as a friend to do her a \u201cfavour\u201d and manufacture duplicates.\n\ni said no, again, and her husband shouted through that it didn\u2019t matter they would just use the trust to provide for kids like it\u2019s supposed to. i retorted that it was for my nephew and good luck accessing it for that because the trust requires my signature to pay out.\n\ni wasn\u2019t even home before he was calling me to apologise, clearly unaware i held the reigns to my late brothers money. the apology was insincere and i asked to speak to my former sil where i confirmed again i wouldn\u2019t be manufacturing her anything. i\u2019ll still be an uncle to my nephew and be impartial when it comes to her accessing my nephews trust but her husband has burned a lot my goodwill with this.\n\naita for not doing her a favour after all that?", "a couple of weeks ago, my friend got married. her husband\u2019s family is rich so they had a huge and very formal wedding, complete with a stunning 4-course meal. she posted the food menu in advance and i found out very quickly that i didn\u2019t like many of the meals. her family loves seafood so she had things like baked scallops, lobster tail, crab cakes, etc. all seafood options. now this might sound heavenly to some people, but i really dislike seafood and the vegetarian alternatives didn\u2019t sound much better so i asked my friend if i could just bring my own food.\n\nshe said yes. nice! at the dinner reception after the wedding, i ordered some burgers from a popular fast food chain to be delivered. not going to say which one but there\u2019s only a few that you can really guess. \n\nanyhow, as i was eating my food, everyone just kept side eyeing me. i know i probably looked weird, eating a fast food hamburger while everyone else ate scallops and stuff, but i also felt like i was being majorly judged. my friend (the bride) also gave me that weird side eye at some point.  \n\nafter the dinner portion was over and people started dancing/socializing more, one of the bridesmaids told me that it would have been more \u201cproper\u201d to eat something that \u201cdidn\u2019t draw so much attention.\u201d so i guess she was referring to the paper bag and drink i had since it did kind of stand out. \n\nnot a big deal but i don\u2019t know, i guess the comment just got me thinking. aita here reddit?\n\n**edit**: so i get it, i\u2019m the asshole and need to apologize to my friend and reevaluate my relationship with food. but damn is it the aita norm these days to receive death threats in your direct messages box? some of you guys really need to go to therapy if you\u2019re getting so worked up over my post and think telling people to kill themselves is appropriate behavior", "my gf and i are both in our mid 20s. she brought me to her childhood home. she has tons of stuffed dolls and animals. like a ton. \n\nshe got really excited in seeing her childhood toys and quickly started explaining to me how she named each one and remembered almost all of them still. she and her mom hand-sewn clothes for each of her stuffed animals and she'd put old bracelets as jewelry on them. she was super happy to see them again and explained to me how she would make up back stories for them as a kid and they all had unique personalities and families. she jokingly said she believed they were real because of toy story.\n\nthis was all so much and i jokingly said \"you were psychotic as a child.\" but i guess my tone sounded rather serious. she got offended immediately. she said that she was a normal child and she just liked to play. i tried to just say itbwas just a joke but she got really upset at me and stormed off. now i feel like an asshole.", "\n\ni'll preface this by saying that my husband (33) has a friend \"carl\" (33) who he considers to be one of his closest friends. my husband sometimes calls carl his \"nicotine\" because of how much he misses him and wants to spend time with him, they do everything together, they're even co workers working the same job.\n\n\nunfortunately, carlos's wife passed away from cancer 3 months ago which caused him to distance himself. my husband felt devastated for him, he recently started spending more time with him and brought him meals and new clothes. \n\nwe planned a 3 day vacation to another state. i made a hotel reservation for 2. unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) i only found out when he went to pick him up. i sucked it up after my husband explained that carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. the problem is money is tight and since carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.\n\nmy husband said we should just share one room and i again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. first night, i was in bed when my husband and carl got back, i got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and carl would take the bed. i asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time i can't share a bed with carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. i told him i didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull \"carl is a widower\" card. i told carl to get out then got up and got dressed to go home. my husband started yelling me calling me irrational but i wasn't having it. i left the hotel and traveled back home. carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that i was making this non-issue an issue.\n\nthey got back and my husband refused to even talk about but still said i ruined this for carl and us and acted abhorrently and disgustingly. i admit carl is struggling and i mightve ruined this for him but i didn't even know he was coming.", "so, my dad and stepmom have way too many kids. i (15m) have a bio sister (13f) and 7 adopted siblings, 3 boys and 4 girls. all of them were in foster care and most of them have some issues and you have to walk on eggshells around them. \n\nthis story is mostly about the oldest, abby (15f). they just took abby in a few months ago and are trying to adopt her. before abby, my dad and stepmom said they were done fostering and adopting kids but two girls they adopted like 3 years ago are abby's bio sisters so they decided to take her in too. i'd have to say abby's the worst out of the adopted kids. she doesn't really talk when we're all together. she just sits next to my stepmom or one of the nannies. she also gets really weird about her stuff, like if she had a pack of cookies and i ate one she wouldn't eat them anymore and would go find something else to eat. same with video games. she likes to play minecraft and she'll let us join her but if you touch anything that she built the whole world is suddenly ruined for her. \n\nmy dad and stepmom put a snack bar in abby's room because there are days where she won't leave her room and sometimes doesn't let anybody in and they think this will get her to eat on those days. i checked it out once when she was in therapy and she has really good snacks in there. she also loves music and has a crap ton of headphones. like she has airpods pro, airpods max, 2 different kinds of bose headphones, and another kind but i don't know what it is. she came with one of the bose and the other kind but the rest were gifts from my dad, stepmom, and their family. she always has headphones on and makes sure they're all charged all the time. it's kinda an obsession for her. \n\nabby and my stepmom and my sister were hanging out in my dad's room and i needed headphones but i couldn't find mine so i went to abby's room (which is strictly off limits to anyone besides my stepmom and one of the nannies), borrowed the airpods max's and took a fruit roll up and bag of cookies from the snack bar. no harm was done and i was going to charge the headphones and give them back when i was done with them. \n\nabby went in her room and knew that someone was in there and threw a temper tantrum. it took my stepmom and the nanny all day to calm her down. they found out i went in her room and tried to ground me but i think she was overreacting and if anything she should be punished for the temper tantrum. after they tried to ground me, i called my mom, told her what happened, and she came to pick me up so i wouldn't be grounded for abby's temper tantrum. \n\nnow my dad's mad at me for breaking the rules and going to my mom to get out of punishment and my mom for not punishing me so i wanted to know if i was the asshole.", "\ni lost my son connor 5m ago. he was in the military. only 24 years old. he was kind and sweet. losing him

relief. i just love drinking my coffee there in the morning and sit on his bed and look at his touches all over the walls. it just warms my heart. i'm proud of him because he had no selfishness, never

and berating them. my niece was shocked by my reaction. she said i overreacted and she'd clean it up later. i told them to get out of the room. pack their things and leave. my niece called me harsh, cruel and unreasonable. she kept asking if connor would've wanted me to treat her like this. i insisted they just leave. leave immediately. they left an hour later. my family heard. my sister said i shouldn't have kicked them out. the reason she can't take them is because her husband doesn't want niece's fiance at his home due to family disagreement. my sister said i was in the wrong and i overreacted shamed me for being unsupportive and inconsiderate.\n\nthe guest room only has mattresses so they weren't directly sleeping on the floor. they were okay with it at first but they started

years ago. a drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. my car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. i also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). i'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but i'm learning to deal with them. i got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money i purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one i lost. when i have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. i still limp but some days i don't have as pronounced a limp.\n\nearlier today i went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her girlfriend, and our mother. i drove. i had to learn to drive with my left foot but i'm really good at it now. i also bought a new car with my money

back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) i have a handicap placard for my car. i have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. today i did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one i took and went down and around. he was still on the other aisle when i pulled in so i didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.\n\nhe parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how i'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. he then ordered me to move. my group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. i'm sick of people thinking that just because i'm young that i don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. i said \"okay\", and went to the car and got in like i was going to drive off. i was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when i sat down i took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. i then asked him if it was okay if i still parked there. he walked away calling me

coworkers as we have worked in our respective jobs for years and like them all. as i checked that off the list, amy spoke up and said everyone from my job can come except my work friend tally (26f). tally is also one of my close friends so this surprised me that amy didn't want to invite her. she has met tally multiple times and there didn't seem to be any issues. when i asked why, she said she just doesn't like her and finds our friendship uncomfortable, saying she thinks that tally is the type of person to try to sway taken men and be the center of attention. after talking some more to see where she got this idea, it turned out this was based on nothing but tally's looks as even amy admitted that tally is always very kind to her. but still, amy is adamant about tally not going and said that she makes her insecure. amy is a beautiful woman so i dont know why she feels this way.\n\ni told amy that if it makes her feel comfortable not having tally at the wedding then that is fine, but before invitations go out i wanted to speak to her privately to let her know to save embarrassment. amy agreed and that was really that, we didn't speak on the matter after. a week or so later i went into work and tally started to ignore me, only really talking if it was work related. i was confused as it isnt just her, our coworkers have started to ignore her and acting strange to me. so i contacted her bf, only for him to be sarcastic on the phone. i asked what the problem was when he asked if i actually didnt know what happened. he then filled me in. turned out a few days earlier amy came to my work on my day off with invitations (i had no idea she even made them yet) and handed everyone an invite in front of tally, then saying to tally \"you aren't invited, women like you aren't welcome\" which has sparked everyone suggesting she is my \"other woman\". since then she has been harassed by some guys at work and shunned by the women. she is now looking for another job.\n\nthis pissed me off and i apologised profusely as i didn't know. when i got home that night i confronted amy about this. she denied it at first, but then told me she did it but it is now not an issue because she's quitting her job. i flipped on her saying how she clearly didnt trust me to say and that she crossed a line doing all this behind my back. she didn't see the problem and got upset asking me why i'm so mad, me responding \"if we are really going to get married, get your insecurities in check and grow up\". i stayed at a friends since but have had texts from amy, her friends and her

bit confused, i asked why. she told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. while i agree with that, i told her that i'm not going to turn it off. she then basically told me that i am an asshole for not considering other people around me. is she right?\n\n&amp;#x200b;", "my friend suggested i post this here to show my daughter why she's being unreasonable. title sounds bad but you'll see why it's actually for the best\n\nmy partner's daughter (20)  is well.. awful. she was a very dower kid and often made things very difficult in our house with extreme meltdowns and mean behavior towards my daughter. this was always an issue for my daughter (23), but she handled things pretty well and understood the position im in with her stepmom. but our coexistence all came crashing down 2 yrs ago when my daughter unleashed on her ss and sent her a long angry message about how she was treated and her opinion of her.  in my opinion... her ss was indeed a terror, but my daughter is 3 and a half years older and should have understood the tight spot i was in and been the bigger person. sd is still a little moody, but she stopped being mean to my daughter a few years ago. time has passed and its time to move on.\n\nthis understandably made things very difficult for me. my wife dislikes my daughter now and my sd hates her. my daughter has barely spoken to me for the last two years since i moved across the country with her stepmom and blew up at me about stuff that happened in the last ten years with her step mom and sister... petty childish tit for tat stuff like not getting new stuff like her sister, the food in the house being stuff her sister liked, or her sister being mean to her with no interference from us(she claims it rose to the level of bullying but my own sister, a teacher, said that's just how siblings are and i agree).   she thinks her stepmom treated her sister better, but my wife was very kind to my daughter by thinking of her at all.. many step parents wouldn't and she was never mean to her- only disliking her to protect her own daughter when mine decided to be confrontational. my wife is the breadwinner, and i am not my daughter's only parent, so she did not have to have everything be equal in my house. my sd on the other hand only has her mother, so of course things were slightly skewed in her favor at ours. thats the way it should work! \n\n**on to the issue at hand... she came to visit for the first time and saw that we don't have photos of her in the house. i have photos of her in my office in the garage, but she's upset  that there are none of her in public in the house unlike sd. my wife doesn't want to subject my sd to photos in the house of someone who messaged her telling her she was a brat, and i can't blame her. sd lives here, and daughter doesn't. why would we have photos of her in view of sd?**", "my biological family is dead. i was raised in foster care, and so my friends are my family. i met my late husband in college. he was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). as an adult, i've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. my late husband and older son died in a car crash.\n\nmy daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. i tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. so, i did it.\n\nsome of them, like her father and my son, i have actual information for aside from that they're dead. but for most of my family and her paternal family, i literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.\n\nit was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures i have of any ancestors are just headstones. i made a trip when my husband and i first married to take pictures of the headstones, so i included those in there. i only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where i could only label maybe 3 people. i don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but i put some of the old ones in there too.\n\nso while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. now i'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. they're appalled that i allowed such a \"morbid\" report and are saying i traumatized their children. i don't think i did anything wrong. they wanted a report on her biological ancestors, i gave it, and kept it g-rated. i just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. i don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. death is part of life. most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept. aita?", "my best friend and i are the type to always pull pranks on each other, it's just how our friendship formed and we always get a kick out of it.\n\nfor example, he once invited me to a party and told me to wear a costume and when i got there, it was normal attire. i laughed after the initial embarrassment, and like i said we are comfortable enough to do that to each other.\n\nhe held a wedding this past weekend, (socially distant, everyone was spread out and it was entirely outdoors). in the weeks leading up to the wedding, i told my girlfriend to wear white as it was expected all the women would wear it. she was reluctant but i told her that it was just a quirky thing the bridge and groom were doing, so she said \"ok\" and bought a white dress.\n\nwhen we got to the wedding, it was standard wedding attire and my girlfriend was mortified. when my best friend saw what i had done, he was cracking up and joked \"i guess you two are getting married instead of us!\"\n\nthe bride was pissed off and made a huge deal out of it. normally she is really chill so i was surprised by her anger. my friend even tried to calm her down and told her it was just clothing and it doesn't change anything.\n\nnow i feel incredibly bad by what happened. i really didn't think it

she expected that she'd only be there a few hours, but at the hospital, her dad fell into a coma and she asked if it was okay if her son stayed overnight with me. of course, i said yes.\n\nthe next evening when she came to pick him up she was livid that he hadn't been bathed although he was by no means filthy, just a little sweaty, maybe from the upset in his routine.\n\nhere's the thing: her son is autistic and terrified of showers. i did not have a bathtub at the time and knowing his terror of showers (i'd babysat him before and she had left directions to fill the tub without him in the bathroom because even that triggers him) i opted to clean him with baby wipes and a warm washcloth, which he was cooperative with.\n\nshe put him in his car seat and then returned to the house to say that i'd messed up his bedtime routine, she couldn't believe i'd send her son home dirty, and she thought i was a better friend than that, and i needed to be more sensitive to the needs of autistic kids. she posted this rant on her social media once she arrived home.\n\nnow, i thought our time together had gone well- he cried for about fifteen minutes after drop-off, but after, we watched his favorite show, ate a snack, and i put him to bed. in the morning he woke up asking for her, but no tears; breakfast and lunch were eaten, we played some of his sign language games, cuddled with my cat, then i wiped him as clean as i could.\n\nso, aita? should i have pressed the shower issue? i admittedly have very limited experience with autism, he's the only person i know who has been diagnosed and based on her prior instructions i felt i did the best i could in the circumstances.", "i've had a long engagement with my fianc\u00e9 (got engaged december 2019),we were supposed to get married in 2021 but you can understand why that couldn't happen.\n\nso our wedding happened this past weekend. one of my best friends was supposed to attend as a bridesmaid but she skipped last minute because of an emergency. to be honest i was mad she skipped because the emergency happened almost a week ago so she had time to figure things out and attend.\n\nso what happened was that her fianc\u00e9 got a car accident and was hospitalised. he was hospitalised for 5 days and on friday he got discharged to go home. my friend had told me from the moment he got into the accident that she'll skip the wedding just to be sure and i told her we'll see. so when i saw that he got discharged on friday i expected my friend to show up at the wedding after all since his situation is not as dangerous right now and i texted her but she said that she'll not be able to make it.\n\nshe kept saying how he's still not well and being discharged doesn't mean he can stay alone without care for many hours and since my wedding day would start at 9am on saturday with the prepepartions etc, the ceremony would be at 7pm on saturday evening and the reception/party would last until sunday morning hours she couldn't be away from home for that long and she said she could compromise if she could only attend the ceremony.\n\ni said i don't want her there just for the ceremony and she's a bridesmaid and supposed to be by my side the entire time. i also said that she should find him some care for the day so she can freely attend the wedding and i suggested inviting either her parents or a friend to stay with him for that day (his parents live far away). she said its not the same and she won't feel right being away for the entire day.\n\ni got pretty upset because she seemed to totally disregard my wedding after so long making preparations and while i understand its her fianc\u00e9, i was mad she didn't find a compromise to attend. she claims her compromise would be to just attend the ceremony and then go home again but she's a bridesmaid. if she's not there for the full experience it would be pointless.\n\nshe said i'm an ah for making her feel guilty about caring for her hurt fianc\u00e9 and she said that his situation takes priority over my wedding. she said she's not sorry for prioritising her so's health over me at this point and if i was a good friend i'd understand instead of guilt tripping her and that i better not complain if i'm ever in a difficult situation and i need my husband's help and support and he chooses to attend someone's wedding over

supposed to be, and the most important woman to him is supposed to be me and vice versa. i wouldn\u2019t ever expect to have a man as my maid of honor.\n\nhe said it doesn\u2019t matter how weddings are supposed to be, he wants his friend to be his best woman because she\u2019s his best friend(which i think is debatable). i said no again and now he won\u2019t talk to me without bringing up the

chemo.\n\nhe has recovered enough to live a normal life. i won\u2019t lie, those were very tough years for our family. my daughter is an only child and was used to our full attention and engagement. it was a hard transition for her to have her father not be able to care for her like he used to and myself having to split my time between her and my husband.\n\nwe had a lot of support from our family and we were able to maintain her lifestyle with their help. she didn\u2019t have to quit any teams, she never missed school. i do acknowledge that emotionally there was damage so we did family

room.\n\nmy husband and i have been arguing about how this was handled. he thinks that an apology is not big deal, and he was hurt by what she said but that \u201che could take it\u201d. i think that

this opportunity to punish your daughter by refusing to attend her wedding, rather than taking responsibility for any harm you caused her in the past.", "yta - you knew exactly how they would react when you told her to go ahead and give herself a cavity search without asking any questions first.", "nta. you should not try to control people's personal choices especially their physical appearance. also if you feel strongly about this tell her directly instead of making judgments behind her back.", "yta - you are being way too sensitive over this. if you don\u2019t want to eat what she offers you then say \u201cno thanks\u201d instead of making excuses about how veganism isn\u2019t enough to keep you from eating non-vegan things around others.", "yta you should pay half because she got to use your house and stuff while you were gone so they\u2019ll probably say that you owe them money. also, how did she know what would happen? who knows what else could have happened!", "nta. i don't think you're an asshole. the fact that she's asking you to go out of your way and disrupt your schedule so she can save money on transportation seems pretty reasonable. if you really wanted to help her, you could offer to pay for the extra cost yourself instead of making her use a taxi.", "yta - you made sure to let everyone know how much you hate her refusals to smile in pictures and how you think they\u2019ve caused problems for yourself throughout life. it seems like you\u2019re trying to make her feel guilty about something she has little control over, especially since you haven\u2019t been supportive of her decisions regarding smiling in photographs.", "yta - you could have moved out before they wanted to get married, which means you are being selfish.", "yta - your gf made a very expensive dish and trusted you enough to make it for you guys to enjoy together. then you went behind her back and took half of it without asking. you may feel like you weren\u2019t doing anything wrong by taking the leftover, but clearly she did put effort into making something special for you two to share. you should respect that and ask before taking any more of her cooking than you originally agreed upon.", "yta - you were aware of what might happen so why didn\u2019t you take steps to prepare yourself better instead of letting your wife be upset without doing something about it?", "nta - i understand your point of view, but your boyfriend should have stood up for himself and told his friends no, instead of letting them dictate what he does. your expectations are valid, especially when you pay for half of everything.", "yta - you are being ridiculous. you weren't even bleeding!", "nta - if you want to treat yourself then you should pay for it yourself. your kids will learn how to manage their own money eventually and they won\u2019t need to rely on dad\u2019s handouts forever!", "nta - you are right about how this makes you look bad. you shouldn't let anyone dictate who comes along. you can always try to talk to her again once things calm down, but don't get sucked into anything more than that.", "yta - you were completely within your rights here. if you had known she was there, you would have locked the door beforehand, so you weren't being disrespectful by leaving it open.", "yta - you could\u2019ve simply apologized and let them know that you were willing to compromise without throwing tantrums and disrespecting them.", "yta - you know what would be funny? if all these petty little hoa nazis stopped attending any events hosted by anyone who had ever been accused of anything even remotely related to breaking some obscure rule they\u2019d have no money coming from any event anymore. you should start an anti hoa movement and call it \u201cthe good times\u201d.", "nta - you are providing a service, not running a charity. also, who knows how many other people passed through?", "yta - firstly, she needs to understand that being around little ones may make her uncomfortable but that\u2019s okay! she shouldn\u2019t treat those tiny humans like garbage; secondly, she\u2019s completely wrong: kids aren\u2019t \u201centitled\u201d or \u201cdumb\u201d. many young children simply haven\u2019t learned self-control yet; lastly, if she\u2019s already proven herself unable to handle these situations gracefully, then maybe she isn\u2019t good enough for you.", "nta if you are using it as motivation to lose some pounds then okay, no problem at all! however, making it sound like you are entitled to stay in the lower bunk forever and ever is just kind of grossly rude.", "nta - you did nothing wrong. not only does your mother need to get some boundaries set by others, but these people sound like creepers anyways. i can see why you got upset with them going through your house without permission and looking into your business.", "nta you are absolutely right! why should you care if you had fun doing something different from what others wanted?", "yta - you\u2019ve known what kind of person mil is for years. if you were so bothered why did you marry her?", "yta - you aren't the first person who thinks their child's partner isn't good enough. everyone does at least once! but usually people grow out of it eventually. you may think you raised your kids better than most parents do, but it doesn't sound like you gave them much room to breathe. now you seem to be trying to control every aspect of their life including who they date. let it go already! your son seems happy with his partner. you should respect their choices instead of trying to dictate their lives.", "nta you\u2019ve been paying for this yourself so far, why shouldn\u2019t you decide? she can pursue whatever interests she wants once she\u2019s old enough to afford it without parents\u2019 financial support.", "yta - you are essentially stealing from your school by making false claims of damage and getting them to replace something they don't need to replace. while i understand why you might want an improved living situation, there are proper channels to go through if you have issues with accommodations at your school instead of resorting to fraudulent actions like this one.", "nta you are not being unreasonable here especially considering how often your brother lies to you. it\u2019s clear he is manipulating you which isn\u2019t fair.", "nta you don't need to change anything except maybe putting more effort into decorum with how you present yourself. you do not owe anyone an explanation why you think the way you do. if people cannot handle being treated like adults instead of children, you don't have to accommodate them.", "yta - you are raising children with no sense of empathy. they will grow up without understanding how their actions affect others around them.", "nta. you seem like an incredibly selfish and entitled parent who doesn\u2019t want any part of raising children. you\u2019re not going to fix anything here by punishing zoey further. instead, you need to talk to both zoey and the rest of the family about how important personal space and boundaries are, especially when living under the same roof.", "yta because if this happened in my household then i would be calling the police. what kind of person gets defensive when asked to show them evidence of no pictures being taken of minors? this woman has issues.", "yta - you are right to be concerned about your sister\u2019s relationship. yes, she does sound like she\u2019s making decisions based solely on convenience rather than genuine feelings for one another.", "nta. you may disagree with her views, but calling her transgender is wrong. she said nothing about identifying as male or female. just that you guys are taking away all the boy things from the baby which seems silly to her. she also didn\u2019t say she wanted a girl. she said she wants her sons to dress \u201clike\u201d their father.", "yta - while i understand why people might find this entertainment, it seems kind of mean spirited to share something about someone who has been drinking enough to be unable to walk.", "yta, you are the a$$. you've been carrying their kid for them; they shouldn't even care whether or not you get to take a break.", "nta you're an enabling parent who needs to get off your kids asses and stop letting them act irresponsibly.", "yta - you are not responsible for managing someones insecurities. it\u2019s their problem to deal with them and they shouldn\u2019t be making demands on you because of their feelings.", "yta - you are not going to be able to fix any issues between yourself and your sister-in-law through insults and jokes about her marriage problems. this kind of behavior will only make things worse and cause tension within your relationship with your husband and his immediate family. if you wish to repair relationships you must approach them calmly, respectfully, and without anger towards anyone involved.", "yta - you have no right to be upset here. firstly, you said yourself that you don't do anything related to her except for wearing the scrunchie once a year which isn't exactly going out of your way. secondly, you didn't tell anyone else about this tradition so why should they care? thirdly, your gf shouldn't have an issue with something that doesn't affect her directly unless she has some personal reason to dislike it. lastly, why would you think that she would want you to stop doing something that makes you happy?", "nta. you\u2019re absolutely right. they shouldn\u2019t have shown up with their children without permission. also, if they felt like something wasn\u2019t right, they should have spoken beforehand instead of showing up late and creating an issue.", "nta - my wife has been complaining about me not doing enough around the house for years, so i started making sure to do things that she doesn\u2019t like just to get back at her. this time it was taking out the trash without asking if she wanted help with something else first.", "yta - your sister seems like an awesome person who would never do anything harmful to something you love. by letting them use it at home, you allowed them to play with something special in the comfort of their own space without having to worry about preserving it 100%. your father gave you his creative work because he trusted you. stop being possessive!", "nta you were right to be upset about what happened, however instead of taking it out on jeramy why don\u2019t u take it out on ur husband for bringing up such an insensitive thing? he should understand by now that you will always trust your kid before anyone else especially if they are lying about something so serious!", "nta you were very polite and respectful towards him while trying to help your child feel safe after being yelled at by him.", "nta. you are not paying their tuition fees and they are adults who make decisions about their future partnerships. he knows what kind of support you give them. let him deal with consequences of his choices.", "yta. this guy isn\u2019t just unaware, he\u2019s actively hostile towards people with disabilities.", "nta - you were trying to make a good time for all of them by giving stephie the switch during the party. stephie has probably seen plenty of expensive gifts given out at parties before and hasn\u2019t seemed impressed. and it sounds like jolene\u2019s mom is way too concerned about material possessions anyways.", "yta - you can understand why your wife would feel upset here! what you need to realise though is that there is no way to make hannah pay back something which was meant to be given away freely. if anything, you could consider giving some of the money to charity, and then tell hannah where it went, and let her know how much you appreciate her help towards getting your wife the new job.", "yta. you were already given an opportunity to disclose your financial situation before she gave away any gifts, and now you\u2019re trying to make excuses not to give back half of what she gave you.", "nta - you have every right to be there for your child\u2019s birth! even if they don\u2019t want you there they can\u2019t stop you from being there, so go ahead and enjoy it and make sure your grandchild knows their family history because your daughter-in-law seems like an idiot who thinks she deserves more respect than what you have given her.", "nta - you aren't being an asshole for having her over and including her in breakfast, especially considering she had nowhere else to go at 3am after getting drunk and driving somewhere. your son needs to understand that people get over breakups eventually and that there's no need to keep his distance forever. you guys did nothing wrong, and it sounds like your son is just looking for something to be mad at you about.", "nta - you aren\u2019t being unreasonable here! david sounds like a bit of a player, who may well use your brother only until something better comes along, so you do have every right to tell your brother where to get off and to be careful!", "yta - you lied by omission. there\u2019s no excuse for lying to your family about what happened during pregnancy, especially since it seems unlikely that they wouldn\u2019t find out sooner rather than later. also, you may think \u201cbiology doesn\u2019t matter\u201d right now, but it will absolutely matter once those children reach puberty and start asking questions, and then you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d been honest long ago.", "yta you don\u2019t need to justify yourself. she doesn\u2019t care about your feelings or how much energy you have left after working. she only cares about herself and her own convenience. you can stay dirty until hell freezes over before you compromise your health.", "yta - you are absolutely the asshole here. first, you should not have given away any part of your gf's collection without asking her permission. second, even if you did think it was okay, you were wrong to offer it to another woman you just met. third, you were completely disrespectful towards jade when she expressed herself over something important to her. fourth, you never gave her a chance to calm down before accusing her of being dramatic which only caused things to escalate. finally, now that everything is blown way out of proportion, you seem unphased with what's happening between you and your gf. your actions don't show respect towards anyone involved including yourself.", "nta. you are not being ableist. the fact that you care enough to ask questions means you genuinely love her. also, she should\u2019ve seen coming. your girlfriend has known you for ten whole years! it\u2019s completely understandable why you wouldn\u2019t want to risk bringing more suffering onto yourself or another human. i hope they work through this together but if you need support during this time please reach out to reputable sources online.", "yta - you did not cause any problems here. the problem is your sister's priorities are wrong. if she had planned better, you\u2019d have seen most things at the wedding. you don\u2019t need to make amends; you already did by leaving after being made into an unpaid babysitter.", "nta - your comments were completely warranted.", "yta - if you were going to get upset over something like this, you would have been long gone before your nieces wedding.", "nta. your wife sounds like an enabler.", "nta you are clearly not the problem here.", "yta - if you want to support yourself you need to find a job where you don\u2019t have to rely on your spouse\u2019s income!", "nta you shouldn't be giving candy to babies because they won't eat it anyways. also it sucks that these people think its okay to take advantage of children to get things for free.", "yta - you don\u2019t care what happens to your child because you are too selfish and entitled. you want your child to do everything perfectly while making no effort to help them achieve their goals. your daughter is struggling to keep up with school, work, and life and yet all you see is how much money she owes you rather than how hard she is working.", "nta. you\u2019ve every right to be angry at your husband for secretly recordings your therapy sessions without consent! you may need to seek legal advice regarding privacy laws which apply here since you are protected under them!", "nta. you sound pretty normal for being a parent who doesn\u2019t share your child\u2019s hobbies. if this were a problem maybe you could try learning more about some of these things. however, given how far apart from each other you both seem to be, maybe just accepting the relationship you currently have would be best instead of trying too hard to change yourself.", "yta - you\u2019re not trying to \u201cforgive\u201d matt so much as try to erase what happened & pretend like nothing ever happened. you don\u2019t care if he learns anything from this experience; you simply want things back to normal without consequences.", "nta. you don\u2019t want people staying in your house who don\u2019t respect your boundaries.", "nta. those people sound horrible. what kind of person leaves their own children out in the cold while making sure everyone else gets taken care of except them?", "yta. you should be happy she isn't eating junk food like potato chips instead of \"baby\" food.", "nta. you are right. you should never give away anything without permission especially family heirloom items. if she wants to keep the items then allow her to buy them instead of just giving them away because she looks good in them. your granny may have given these items to her so she can pass them along to their next owner which could be one of your children.", "nta you\u2019d have been better off just saying \u201chey, that\u2019s one way to get a leg up.\u201d", "yta because while dan may have thought his mother would accept his decision to pursue an education before getting engaged, it\u2019s highly unlikely that she would agree with him breaking off his engagement. dan also needs to understand that no matter who he chooses to spend his life with, he can\u2019t expect anyone else to put aside their own goals and dreams to accommodate those choices.", "nta. first off, people do live with their families until marriage and having kids all the time these days. secondly, it\u2019s none of your business where your neighbors family members live. lastly, you were responding to something that was said about you, which makes it fair game.", "yta - you are being an insensitive bitch towards jess because her question was completely innocent and not invasive in any way. she genuinely cared about how adam was doing since he has been through a lot lately. i would have appreciated if you had just told her instead of accusing her of asking too many questions like some kind of creepy person who likes invading people\u2019s privacy.", "nta - you are right about having boundaries with commissions like these. while they may think it\u2019s an easy task, it does take up a fair amount of time and effort to complete a handmade item, especially if you want it to look nice enough to sell. if people can\u2019t respect those boundaries then maybe they don\u2019t understand just how long it takes to craft something by hand.", "yta - you are not entitled to dictate what kind of support people give during times of grief, especially ones own blood relatives. your husband did nothing wrong here.", "nta you\u2019ve done nothing wrong here except for trying to make peace where none exists so far. your wife should know better than anyone else that letting go of grudges and forgiving others can help healing both parties involved.", "yta - you are not entitled to decide who gets to take care of your own children. you have an autistic child? you think people should understand that? you need to learn to accept help from others, including your spouse.", "nta you are protecting an adult man who thinks its funny for another human to be ridiculed by having her private parts shown off without consent.", "yta - firstly, calling someone\u2019s clothes \u2018lazy and unattractive\u2019 is not polite criticism; its insulting. secondly, why do you assume she wouldn\u2019t want advice from you? thirdly, why bring this up now after four years? fourthly, why make such a big deal about her clothes especially when she clearly doesn\u2019t give a damn? fifthly, how does she look like a teenager? sixthly, isn\u2019t it time you stopped judging people based on their looks instead of focusing on actual issues like maturity levels? seventhly, wasn\u2019t it rude to use words like \u2018frumpy\u2019? eighthly, weren\u2019t you being selfish by trying to dictate what others wear even though none of them complained? ninthly, what gives you the right to decide what makes a person attractive or otherwise? tenthly, why try to change things now after all those years of doing nothing? eleventhly, why be mean-spirited towards someone who\u2019s done nothing wrong? twelfthly, shouldn\u2019t you respect her decision not to conform to societal expectations regarding fashion? thirteenthly, aren\u2019t you projecting your own insecurities onto someone else? fourtheenthly, didn\u2019t you break rule number two hundred and fifty six of house rules which states: no talking down to people?", "yta you are being unreasonable and cruel. your privacy issue isn\u2019t something new - you have made clear how you feel about it before and yet you allowed her friend to stay in your home despite knowing full well that they would disregard your wishes. when you got caught off guard, you used it as reason to end their tenancy which is unfair. she\u2019s upset because she has lost her place to live and will probably face homelessness.", "nta - it sounds like you are making a genuine effort to be polite but also not being pushed around by these entitled individuals. why should you have to put yourself out because some stranger wants to save a seat? what about those who would rather have more space and comfort than try to reserve everything?", "yta - you are acting entitled and petty here.", "yta - you are basically making yourself into a servant because you think he\u2019ll give you money! he has a very short-term view of relationships.", "yta - this isn\u2019t something to be upset over! it sounds like a lot of effort was put into making sure everyone felt welcome at the reception without breaking the bank. if you guys can afford more elaborate meals then great, but this wasn\u2019t some kind of insult towards mil\u2019s boyfriend, heck his girlfriend even agreed on the menu options offered!", "yta - you are being selfish asking for equal treatment when you aren\u2019t disabled.", "nta. you don\u2019t need to be rude to him though. it\u2019s understandable you want some peace and quiet during certain hours of the day, especially considering how much you work. try talking to him calmly and explaining why you feel the way you do. maybe compromise could happen whereby he can find a time to get ready for work that doesn\u2019t involve disturbing you too much.", "yta - you were rude and disrespectful to her. if she wants to know your secret, don't make fun of her. she might not care about being thin, maybe she cares about eating better and exercising regularly like you do!", "nta. you didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. victoria shouldn\u2019t go around making moves on someones boyfriend without them being okay with it first.", "nta you\u2019re right. what kind of idiot asks everyone to dress in specific colors? you should never comply with such requests especially since you don\u2019t belong to those \u201cgroups\u201d anyway.", "nta - you should be able to decide what your last name is going to be.", "nta. you are not being unreasonable in asking him to stop engaging in what seems to be some kind of bizarre mating ritual. if you were comfortable watching him do this every time you didn\u2019t have to be alone with them you could just let him continue but since you aren\u2019t that should mean something. also dogs need exercise and playtime and sometimes that can look different depending on the individual animal. however, there needs to be boundaries set between humans and animals especially ones as large as labs.", "yta - you aren't protecting an employee here, you're protecting yourself. this isn't some kind of weird quirk where people can only heat things up in their own personal space, they all have access to those things because you allowed it. you don't know what else goes on outside work, and even if you did, you still wouldn't have any right to police how people run their lives.", "yta - this isn't something to get upset over if you are going to keep being close to taylor then you need to accept people who may wear what makes them happy. everyone has different comfort levels but if taylor really doesn't care and is willing to make himself look good at your wedding then let him do it. you aren't obligated to pay money on a suit just to appease your girlfriend.", "yta you are trying to use your daughter to get back together with her mommy and your daughter does not deserve that.", "nta - you got upset over what could be considered a minor mistake by your mom in law, especially given how easy it is to adjust flavors, and then threw it back into her face during dinner. if anything, you embarrassed yourself and made things worse by making such a huge deal out of it.", "yta - you are not incapable of buying these things yourself. your boyfriend has proven this by getting them for you before even though he claims they were \"embarrassing\". he did nothing wrong here but refuse to do something awkward.", "nta - you should have given everyone a very clear list of what expenses would be covered under the terms of sharing the money and stick to those. you also need to make sure he understands why you don\u2019t want to give money to family members without any kind of agreement in place ahead of time. you may also consider making a separate account specifically for these funds so that you have control over how much goes towards specific things versus general savings.", "yta. you don't deserve an apology from anyone else, especially not from these people. they were being disrespectful towards you and you responded accordingly. yes, you may have taken things further than necessary by reporting him but they shouldn't have done any of those things to begin with.", "nta. your concern for their well-being seems genuine; even though they didn\u2019t accept the gift of free condoms, there\u2019s nothing wrong with expressing concern over their sexual health.", "yta - you were already injured, what kind of person tells their wife off for defending them?", "nta - you should always try to teach children how to treat others right and wrong so they don't grow into adults who act like their abusive parents.", "nta. you are not responsible for what other adults did while waiting in line at your event. you allowed them to participate voluntarily, not forced anyone against their will. most likely these women didn't want to work there anyway and took advantage of a good situation.", "yta - you were upset enough about this issue to take action and find a creative way to deal with it. your bf should appreciate that you are willing to help him out rather than constantly reminding him to get better at hitting the bowl.", "yta. you abandoned your family while they were on vacation. that\u2019s really selfish especially since your dad works so much. your bro might not have done anything wrong by using the car without permission but he should have checked first. also, why would u expect your parents to leave the house like that? if you wanted some space then talk to ur parents! and you still haven\u2019t given any explanation on how u plan to support yourself once you graduate from college.", "nta. you were right on the money when you said \"grow up\".", "nta - if you were going to get money towards college then why did you even care about which universities? you could have just taken the cash and used it however you wanted. i know this isn\u2019t the same thing, but my mom has given me an allowance since middle school and she never said anything about how i had to spend it on specific things. yta", "nta. you aren't marrying anyone until you can afford to throw a huge lavish wedding and buy an expensive ring. otherwise you need to elope.", "nta - you saved his life", "nta - you took your girlfriend somewhere she didn\u2019t want to go because you wanted something specific from her gift.", "nta - sorry, but if you don\u2019t trust your daughter enough to take care of her son\u2019s hair then maybe you should reconsider being involved in their lives. your actions caused unnecessary stress and financial strain on them.", "yta - you are way more important than some stupid pillow and you deserve better treatment from your partner", "nta - you are absolutely right. there is no way you should have given any more money to your son who is perfectly capable of paying back his own student loan debts from college without having to resort to stealing money meant for another child who has since passed away.", "nta - you are still making payments towards the car and plan to replace the funds once u can afford to do so, this isn't like taking out thousands of dollars and buying something unnecessary with no intentions of replacing the funds... also, your ex has been putting in more money than you, but if you didn't use those funds then there would be nothing to give back anyway.", "yta - you are acting selfishly here in this situation. if she wants to spend time with an old friend who is ill, she should do that instead of trying to make excuses to avoid spending quality time with your son.", "nta. there are plenty of reasons for not wanting to be hounded into staying somewhere beyond one\u2019s will. especially in situations where it would make others feel uncomfortable to have to deal with awkward goodbyes or even worse having to call off plans on account of some guest who doesn\u2019t want to leave.", "yta you are not a pedophile, this is just an excuse", "nta, you\u2019re not obligated to make excuses to justify changing something that doesn\u2019t bother him.", "yta - you are clearly not going to tell him. you\u2019ll probably spend the rest of your life avoiding him because \u201che won\u2019t understand.\u201d", "nta you are doing nothing wrong here. he left your husband and caused pain to everyone involved including the children. now he wants you to come around so he can get away with being selfish and unfaithful. you shouldn\u2019t let anyone make you feel guilty about standing up for yourself especially since he has proven himself to be untrustworthy multiple times over.", "yta you\u2019ve effectively bullied this young woman into taking the video down by threatening legal action against her while simultaneously making yourself look like a victim. furthermore, you seem to be implying that anyone whose laptop isn\u2019t \u201cthe latest model\u201d doesn\u2019t deserve to use technology at all, which is patently absurd. finally, you\u2019ve accused this girl of being privileged simply based on the fact that she owns something you think should belong only to those more wealthy than you; this is a classic case of projection. stop acting like a drama queen and accept that you were wrong for what you did.", "yta. you don\u2019t need an apology here, you made sure she knew what would happen if she kept being ungrateful and entitled like this.", "nta you are right! if anyone thinks taking care of children all day is easy then they need to try it themselves.", "nta. he made a thoughtless comment and then apologized once confronted - which isn\u2019t enough given how serious the topic is. you weren\u2019t trying to make him \u201clook bad\u201d though - you simply stated a fact and why you felt upset by his comment.", "nta. you\u2019re protecting your husband who can no longer walk, talk, eat without assistance, etc\u2026and you have taken great effort to provide the most comfort possible for him. if anyone deserves closure it would be jason and if they don\u2019t understand why then they deserve some kind of punishment!", "nta you are completely right. if you would have given away one of your own belongings, she probably would have been okay with it even though she's only 31 and has seven years left until retirement. you are absolutely right!", "nta. you\u2019ve given clear boundaries on what kind of behavior you will tolerate from her, which is fair because she doesn\u2019t respect those boundaries, but you don\u2019t need to do anything more than tell her that you won\u2019t cook for her anymore. it sounds like you were willing to let her eat leftovers and even made extra food for her beforehand. she chose to throw everything out rather than eat any of it.", "nta - you were right. even though you didn't mean to be rude, you did make her uncomfortable and humiliated which may cause harmful effects long term. it seems that you let your emotions cloud your judgement. try having more self control before acting.", "nta. if you can afford it then pay for yourself and your wife to go on another vacation instead of using money that could potentially help fund medical treatment for your father-in-law.", "yta - you should put your boob away before answering the door period.", "nta - you have every right to stand by what you say. your child has been taught about

making over three hundred thousand dollars after completing her education? you haven't seen her financial future yet! what kind of doctor does she plan to become?", "nta. you are being reasonable here. your husband made some pretty big mistakes in the past - why should you bail him out? he\u2019s trying to force this guilt trip onto you and your children by bringing them into it. he needs to accept responsibility for his own actions before expecting others to do so.", "yta - if you were genuinely concerned for your daughters welfare then why did you leave the wedding rather than take steps to calm her down? if you were more invested in protecting your child from embarrassment than helping them cope with their issues they would never learn to deal with these situations properly.",

minor and blown out of proportion here. there are plenty of people who aren't going to use baby talk on their kids even though they love them and care for them. i think what you want would be weird.",

clearly straight, and don\u2019t actually care about gays being treated poorly. you are using their sexuality against them because you feel threatened.", "yta - if he doesn\u2019t want to talk about your research then you shouldn\u2019t force it. you were being rude by insisting that he listen to you. people should only discuss topics they both care about.", "yta you aren't even thinking about

responsibilities too.", "nta - you were being honest about the biology of sex, which is important for children to understand, even though it may not be comfortable for everyone involved to hear it right now.", "yta - this isn\u2019t just making fun of your eating habit, its calling out childish behavior and disrespectful to your mother who spent time cooking food for everyone including your

relationships so i don\u2019t want to put myself out there only to be hurt again. finally after enough begging from my wife, i relented and created an account just last night. about 20 minutes later, i got a message saying \u201chi! you look like an interesting guy.\u201d i didn\u2019t think anything of it until they started sending more messages asking if we could meet up sometime soon. at first i was hesitant because who knows what kind of crazy people are on these things? however, since my wife really wants me to try it out, i decided that maybe it would help us find each other faster if i went ahead and scheduled something. now here comes the part where it gets weird: i told them that i wanted to make sure we were compatible before meeting somewhere private, so asked them some questions over text such as how long have you been single and do you enjoy spending time alone versus being around others? turns out she said yes to both which made me pretty nervous. then she asked me why i wanted to know all those details and i told her i thought it might tell me whether she\u2019d rather spend time with friends instead of having one-on-one conversations. she laughed and said she didn\u2019t care what i did as long as it wasn\u2019t illegal lol. well anyways, i ended up agreeing to meet her tomorrow evening and i\u2019m feeling very anxious right now. i\u2019ve never gone on a date like this before and i\u2019m worried that i will end up getting scammed somehow. am i an idiot for trusting this stranger online even though my wife says everything seems fine?", "nta - if

now with her co worker who she met at work while working in another state before we were married, i found out about it after she was pregnant with his baby so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t confront him earlier because he said they only had sex once but then later on told me she was pregnant which made me suspicious of course. anyway long story short, I confronted them both and I have pictures to prove everything, I called up their bosses too and got them fired from their job along with getting all evidence destroyed by law enforcement since this is illegal here and even though I don\u2019t want any legal action against them I did file a police report just to be safe. well today my son came home and told me there are rumors going around school about how \u201ci\u2019m a bad dad\u201d and how \u201cmy mom cheated on my dad\u201d and stuff like that. i asked my kid what happened and he says some kids started calling him names saying his mom slept with one guy and then went into another relationship with another man and now he doesn\u2019t know if anyone likes him anymore. i tried telling him not to worry about those idiot kids but he keeps talking about this and crying over it and asking me \u201cdaddy can you please tell them i love you?\u201d which is really breaking my heart right now cause he\u2019s such a good boy and I would do anything to protect him. so I am wondering if y\u2019all think I should talk to the teachers about this? maybe get them involved somehow? maybe get some kind of counselor thing where the teacher talks to the class together about bullying etc? i feel like it might help put things back in perspective for these little brats that they shouldn\u2019t go around spreading lies about people. plus i\u2019ll make sure to keep a close eye on the teachers to see if they actually care about what goes down in their classrooms! let me know what you guys think thanks", "nta - you were struggling financially so you made a difficult decision in an

empathetic towards people who go through difficult times.", "yta - you allowed a kid to get bullied into suicide. you lied to everyone including your own family, and then went along with the lie even

wish to pursue. secondly, autism or any mental disability should never be used as a reason to dismiss something they want to do. thirdly, using your personal career success to influence them is unethical. lastly, it seems like you're trying to force your views onto your child instead of respectfully listening to their desires and helping them find their path.", "nta - you don\u2019t owe

accounts like you did before, and educate them on digital citizenship and internet security. you are doing right by being concerned for your kiddo!", "yta - you've already proven yourself to be

make out like you\u2019ve been wronged here.", "nta. you are not being overly dramatic here. what kind of person would standby silently after their partner threatened to leave them unless they give away their children? you can't take those threats lightly. also, how could anyone think that having a pet inside the house during the daytime would cause such a disturbance? maybe if your wife is extremely sensitive to sounds, which doesn't seem likely given that she isn't bothered by the cats' presence most days.", "nta - you made sure to be clear about your thoughts before bringing it up,

want something special. if you can\u2019t stand to be around people who aren\u2019t willing to do what you say then maybe you should stay home next time instead of going somewhere where there will probably be children crying because their parents won\u2019t let them eat all kinds of sugary foods.", "yta - you are right about everything you say here except for calling her an attention seeker. she doesn't need attention from anyone else; she needs to get over herself.", "yta. you are acting entitled because you are getting paid more then him. if he doesn't find this humorous, good! he may
