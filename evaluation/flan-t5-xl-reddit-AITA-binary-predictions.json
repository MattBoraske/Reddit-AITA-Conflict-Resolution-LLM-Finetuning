{"submission_texts": ["i (31f) am the oldest of four sisters (30, 28, 25). my middle sisters both married before me, and i got married last may. at each of our weddings, our \"something old\" was a flower-shaped hair pin that belonged to our mom. our mom passed away when we were teens, so having that pin was a way for each of us to include her memory in our special days. since i got married most recently, i have the pin at my apartment.\n\nlast week, my youngest sister announced her engagement in our family group chat, then texted me to ask that i send her the pin.\n\nhere's the thing. all my sisters were my bridesmaids, along with some friends. at my bachelorette party, after my friends had left, my sisters and i stayed up, a little drunk and feeling very deep in that post-party kind of way. we started talking about our mother. my middle sisters and i got emotional, saying how much we missed her. my youngest sister, however, was very quiet.\n\ni asked her what was up, and she started talking about how she was always our mom's least favorite, how even when mom was dying she didn't say \"as good\" a goodbye to her as she did to the rest of us, and how \u2013 if mom had lived \u2013 they'd probably have a terrible relationship. my middle sisters and i tried to talk her out of it, saying that of course our mother loved her and stuff like that, but finally my little sister kind of snapped and just shouted, \"look, i hated that fucking bitch, okay?\" then she started crying and went home.\n\nthe next day, i called my sister. i asked her if she'd meant everything she'd said the night before. she said she did. she said that she knew our mother loved her, and she knew our mother never did anything \"bad\" to her, but that she could always tell that our mom \"secretly regretted having a fourth kid.\" she suspected our mom had wanted a son, and had been disappointed by a fourth girl. personally, i don't believe this is true. as the oldest, i had a lot of conversations with my mom before she died that my sisters weren't party to, and she always said that she would have loathed having boys. in fact, i always thought that my youngest sister was her favorite.\n\nmy sister ended the conversation saying, \"look, that woman might have been my mom, but i didn't like her very much.\"\n\ni responded to my sister's text about the pin saying that i wasn't sure why she wanted to wear it, considering her strained relationship with our mother's memory. my sister responded, \"all of you wore it. i should wear it too.\" i don't think she should wear it just because we did. it's supposed to represent our mom's memory, and if she doesn't look at our mom's memory fondly, i don't want her disrespecting the pin by wearing it dishonestly. i told her that i would hold onto the pin for now, and we could discuss it more later if she reflects more on what the pin actually represents.\n\naita?", "\n\ncontext: my husband [33] used to be unemployed for a year, he recently started a job at a warehouse. \n\nyesterday, and while i was about to do the laundry, i grabbed his work pants and digged my hand in it's pockets to empty them before putting it in the washing machine like i\u00a0 always do. \n\nmy husband just happened to walk by and when he saw me searching his pants pockets. he rushed in yelling at me to put his pants down. i already had a folded piece of paper out but he snatched it then started screaming at me about how i have no respect for his privacy and that i shouldn't be getting my hands on his things. i was genuinly dumbfounded i told him to take it easy i alwaye do this before laundry. he lashed out saying i had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one i pulled out. i said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. i asked why and he said i don't get to ask him jack shit after i disrespected his privacy. i almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? it wasn't like a stranger was digging into them. \n\nhe refused to speak to me and later brought a new closet with a lock and moved his clothes inside of it. i asked if he was serious and he said this will teach me to respect his privacy and deter my snooping. then went back to not speaking to me.\n\n\ni'm genuinely confused, aita?", "i was recently flying from nyc to lax for a work trip and i had the displeasure of sitting next to a family and a little boy (9). i got on the plane in the midst of issues with my diabetes and i needed to eat within two hours so i began snacking. i immediately began receiving dirty looks from the parents and the mother said \u201ccan you not do that? our son.\u201d so i put my food away and figured i\u2019d wait until the flight attendant came around so i could buy food from her and eat at an acceptable time just to show some respect for their wishes.  \n\nso the flight attendant comes by with her beverages and snacks, i start to ask for a coke and a snack box, but before i can finish the sentence the father says \u201cnothing for this row, we\u2019re all set here\u201d and she continues on. i go up to press the call light so i can get my food and my drink because i actually need it and the father says \u201cour son has prader-willi, we\u2019d prefer it if you didn\u2019t eat because it causes tantrums when he doesn\u2019t know he can\u2019t eat and he\u2019s always hungry\u201d. i\u2019m close to a tantrum myself at this point and so i look him in the eye and say \u201ci do not care, fly private if you want to control your surroundings\u201d. \n\nthe flight attendant comes back and i get my food and my drink, i snarf it down and chug my soda, and i sit back. as soon as i\u2019m calmed and i\u2019m able to open my laptop and get back to work the mother leans in and says \u201ci feel a calling to educate you about my son\u2019s disease\u201d and i felt my entire body clench up. she keeps talking to me and explaining how i\u2019d made her son feel and i said \u201clisten lady, i don\u2019t fucking care, i\u2019m going to handle my t1d the way i see fit and you\u2019re going to handle your son the way you see fit. i\u2019m not endangering myself because you don\u2019t want to deal with a tantrum, if you want to control other people then you book all the seats in a row or you fucking fly private.\u201d\n\ni recounted the story to a friend of mine once i\u2019d gotten off the plane and she immediately told me that i was a huge ah and i should\u2019ve given them a little bit of grace due to their son\u2019s condition. i kind of feel bad but at the same time, i think that it\u2019s unavoidable if you\u2019re going into public and you\u2019re around others. \n\naita?", "ok, so i know the title sounds bad, but bear with me - i had my reasons.\n\nso, i (22m) have been really struggling to find a job since i graduated this summer. i'm searching in a highly competitive field (think finance), and yesterday was the first time i interviewed somewehre.\n\ni took a small shot of absinthe when i woke up, just to settle my nerves a little. (side note - my grandad was of czech origin, and he loved absinthe. he even used to brew it himself. my final birthday present from him was a novel 200 ml bottle he brought from his homeland. unfortuantely, he passed away a couple weeks ago, so i decided to pour one out for him to ensure good luck in my interview.)\n\nhowever, by the time i was sat in the company's waiting room, the effects had completely worn off. i started to feel sick with nerves - the pressure of the interview stage was getting to me after months of writing applications. i decided to sneak off to the toilet to take a couple of pre-interview shots to calm my nerves. the interview that followed actually went really well - i had great chemistry with the interviewer, and we were laughing, flirting etc.\n\nthe problem came when i, very stupidly, decided to sneak in another shot (for good luck) before the final interview with the ceo. sadly, she emerged from her office precisely as i was mid-gulp. she looked horrified, and told me to leave the building. i tried to explain to her about my anxiety, and how i was simply medicating it, but she wouldn't listen and called security to take me away. afterwards, i sent the company an apology e-mail and asked for another chance, but they haven't yet replied.\n\nmy mother thinks i'm an asshole for drinking at all and called me an alcoholic, (she doesn't really understand alcohol,) but my brother 'doesn't see the issue' as long as i wasn't drunk.\n\nso reddit - who is the asshole? me for drinking before a job interview, or the ceo lady for not listening / calling security?", "so i (f38) my husband (m39) and our 2 kids (f16) and (m14) live in an 800 sqft house in toronto. we would really like to get a bigger house but a 1000 sqft house in this city costs at least $1m so that is completely off the table. the house that we live in has 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom and 1 kitchen/living room. \n\nmy husband and i live in one of the bedrooms while my daughter and son live in the other one. both of the bedrooms are the same size and are rather small but my husband and i are both grown adults and we can both fit together in one of the rooms just fine. the problem now is that my daughter thinks that her room is too small and doesn't want to share it with her younger brother. i asked her about what she wanted to do about this problem and she suggested that her brother moves to the living room couch but i said that i cant just kick him out of his room because his sister wants it for herself. i suggested that we could put up office-style cubicle dividers or a curtain to divide the room in two if she wants privacy but then we both realized that this would be a bad idea since they both share a bunk bed since the room is way too small to realistically fit 2 beds. so, in the end i told her that she can either stay in the room with her brother or she can be the one who moves to the living room since it wouldn't be fair to kick him out because she wants his room to herself. i understand that she wants more space and privacy but what can i do?\n\nso, reddit aita?", "i (m24) had an auto accident over 2 years ago that resulted in a left leg knee amputation, i thought that would been the end of my active lifestyle, i loved all kinds of sports as a kid and i still do.\ni had a very hard time adjusting to my new normal, my parents were able to get me a prosthetic leg that allowed me to get back to running and going trips with my friends like we always do every summer.\n\n\nthe guys were planning an rv trip on the weekend, we had already chosen a destination which was spending some time out in nature and getaway from stress.\n\n\nmy girlfriend asked if she could come along, i told her no, this is a guy's trip, told all my buddies' girlfriends wanted to go but they were firm and put their foot down, she laughed at me for this then tried to convince me to let her come cause she was feeling stressed out from being at home 24h, i already made up my mind, i wasn't going to ruin the trip just because she wants to be on a guy's trip, i promised her a trip when i get back, she got upset and didn't like the idea.\n\nlater on, before i went to sleep, i took my prosthesis off as i do every night, this is my second prothesis, i've already completed a wearing schedule during first year and had to get another prothisis to accommodate any physical changes i had.\n\ni woke up in the morning and i couldn't find my prosthesis, i looked where i put it but it was gone, i asked my girlfriend who was doing heavy cleaning around the place, and she said she didn't see it, i was confused it was near my bed, i asked her to stop being childish and playing games and give back my prosthesis because i knew she took it.\n\nshe's a bad liar couldn't even deny it, she said she wanted to hide it so that i won't go on that trip and leave her alone. i got mad at her for this, i was stunned to find my prosthesis hidden underneath an auto part in the garage, it had been damaged, it was placed in a possession where it had a crack, it was abvious it no longer functions properly, i mean i could still wear it but can't put my whole weight on it cause it would break.\n\ni yelled at her and showed her what she did, she said she didn't mean it, i told her she did mean it because she was being childish and jealous over a trip and now she caused me 7000$ worth damage, i told her she ruined everything, that she owed me a new one and that she needed to pay for a new one.\n\nshe got mad and left, i basically had to use my old crutches it felt absolutely horrible, i called the guys and told them i wasn't coming, it's been a few days, she's mad that i'm still asking her to pay for a new prosthesis and called me an a**** for not apologizing and preferring a \"plastic leg\" over her.\n\ni had to call my parents today to tell them they told me she should at least help pay half the expense of a new prosthesis since she caused damage to it, and then consider my relationship with her.\n\nhave i been an a**** to her ?", "as you know, french bulldogs have breathing issues due to their deformed noses.\n\ni saw a girl jogging with her french bulldog. i told my wife i wanted to say something, but she said not to, so i didn't.\n\na few days later, i saw the same girl and dog around my neighborhood walking, so i took this chance to say something. i told her to please consider her dog's breathing issues when jogging. she told me when she jogs with him, she does intervals of light jogging for 1 min then does 3 mins of walking for 15-20 mins and she only does this every two weeks. never in the summer.\n\ni see where she's coming from, but i told her he's probably not doing too good. she then says he runs constantly in dog parks for more than an hour so he's fine. i told her thats different. she says \"ok i hear you - have a great day!\". honestly this is a rude response since i feel dismissed. so i ask if she's going to stop. she says probably not. at this point i'm mad so i tell her she shouldn't have gotten this breed then.\n\nshe then says \"yea sure.\" then walks away.\n\ni told my wife about this and she said this is one of the dumbest thing i could've done and i should've minded my own business.\n\nso, was i in the wrong?", "i have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only i can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. all the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but i told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.\n\nthings worked pretty well at first but over time i caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. after the third or so time i sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. they all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and i told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.\n\ni came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. i see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead i just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. after this during the middle of the night i took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. it took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. \n\nqueue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. queue bitching. queue tantrums and accusations about me being a \"dicklord\". i don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. i'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when i regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think i'm an ass for good now and i had only created an awkward situation that won't go.\n\ni have no regrets, and i don't think i'm an ass, but given i lurk this sub a lot i'm curious for your verdict in this matter. aita?", "my daughter is 21f and lives in another city for university. she\u2019s here for the holidays for 2 weeks and since all her friends are still at their universities, she has no one to hangout with but she\u2019s not bothered by that since she wanted to spend time with her family aka us. \n\nnow problem is, all of us are sick (not covid just flu we got tested) and so we still stay in our rooms but 2 days ago we went to a family friend\u2019s

just tired. however tonight, daughter came to me and said she wanted to drive to the store and get some snacks so she could watch a movie and asked if i could come with her. the store is 5 minutes away but i wasn\u2019t up to it so i said no ask your brother (her brother is perfectly fine, no flu), a while later she came back saying he said no and asked if she could just drive by herself since it\u2019s so close and shouldn\u2019t be a big deal since she has a license and it\u2019s only 6:30 pm. i still said no after which she got angry and said it\u2019s not fair that we don\u2019t spend any time with her and she\u2019s been trapped at home because we\u2019re sick and that it must not even be serious since we attended a wedding thats outside our city and yet i wont go to a store thats
